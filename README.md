# Semantic-Clustering-NLP
Unsupervised NLP project on Jane Austenâ€™s novels to uncover semantic links between frequent content words. Trained Word2Vec embeddings and used hierarchical clustering with cosine and graph-based (Dijkstra) distances to compare contextual vs. structural similarity and explore their effect on word grouping.
