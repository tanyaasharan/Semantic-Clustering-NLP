# Semantic-Clustering-NLP
Unsupervised NLP project on Jane Austen’s novels to uncover semantic links between frequent content words. Trained Word2Vec embeddings and used hierarchical clustering with cosine and graph-based (Dijkstra) distances to compare contextual vs. structural similarity and explore their effect on word grouping.

## Project Overview
This project explores semantic relationships within literary texts by:
1. Comparing computational methods for defining "word similarity"
2. Analyzing vocabulary usage and meaning patterns in Jane Austen’s novels
3. Moving beyond simple co-occurrence to capture deeper contextual connections
