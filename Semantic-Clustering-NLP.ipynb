      "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\n",
      "and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings\n",
      "of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world\n",
      "with very little to distress or vex her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\n",
      "indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\n",
      "been mistress of his house from a very early period.  Her mother\n",
      "had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\n",
      "remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\n",
      "by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\n",
      "of a mother in affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,\n",
      "less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\n",
      "but particularly of Emma.  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy\n",
      "of sisters.  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\n",
      "office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\n",
      "her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\n",
      "now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\n",
      "friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;\n",
      "highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by\n",
      "her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having\n",
      "rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\n",
      "too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\n",
      "alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present\n",
      "so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\n",
      "with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\n",
      "disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.  It was Miss\n",
      "Taylor's loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day\n",
      "of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought\n",
      "of any continuance.  The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\n",
      "her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\n",
      "of a third to cheer a long evening.  Her father composed himself\n",
      "to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\n",
      "and think of what she had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.  Mr. Weston\n",
      "was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\n",
      "and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\n",
      "with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\n",
      "and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.\n",
      "The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.\n",
      "She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\n",
      "years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\n",
      "years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\n",
      "her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\n",
      "of childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\n",
      "intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\n",
      "unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their\n",
      "being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\n",
      "She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\n",
      "well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\n",
      "interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\n",
      "in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\n",
      "every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\n",
      "as could never find fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was\n",
      "going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must\n",
      "be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,\n",
      "and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\n",
      "natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\n",
      "from intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he\n",
      "was no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation,\n",
      "rational or playful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\n",
      "not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\n",
      "for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\n",
      "of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\n",
      "and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\n",
      "and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\n",
      "at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\n",
      "being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\n",
      "her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must\n",
      "be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next\n",
      "visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,\n",
      "to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\n",
      "to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\n",
      "and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses\n",
      "were first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had\n",
      "many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\n",
      "but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss\n",
      "Taylor for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and Emma\n",
      "could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\n",
      "till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.\n",
      "His spirits required support.  He was a nervous man, easily depressed;\n",
      "fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\n",
      "hating change of every kind.  Matrimony, as the origin of change,\n",
      "was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\n",
      "to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\n",
      "with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\n",
      "when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from\n",
      "his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\n",
      "suppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\n",
      "he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad\n",
      "a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\n",
      "happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.\n",
      "Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\n",
      "from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\n",
      "not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.  What a pity it\n",
      "is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.  Mr. Weston is such\n",
      "a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\n",
      "a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us\n",
      "for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\n",
      "This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,\n",
      "my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\n",
      "us!--We shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay\n",
      "wedding visit very soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.\n",
      "I could not walk half so far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.  We must go in the carriage,\n",
      "to be sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for\n",
      "such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we\n",
      "are paying our visit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.  You know we\n",
      "have settled all that already.  We talked it all over with Mr. Weston\n",
      "last night.  And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like\n",
      "going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.\n",
      "I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.  That was\n",
      "your doing, papa.  You got Hannah that good place.  Nobody thought\n",
      "of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad I did think of her.  It was very lucky, for I would\n",
      "not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;\n",
      "and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\n",
      "pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.  Whenever I see her,\n",
      "she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;\n",
      "and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she\n",
      "always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.\n",
      "I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\n",
      "comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is\n",
      "used to see.  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know,\n",
      "she will be hearing of us.  He will be able to tell her how we\n",
      "all are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\n",
      "and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\n",
      "through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.\n",
      "The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\n",
      "walked in and made it unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\n",
      "only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\n",
      "connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.\n",
      "He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,\n",
      "and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\n",
      "as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.  He had\n",
      "returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked\n",
      "up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.\n",
      "It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\n",
      "and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and her children were\n",
      "answered most satisfactorily.  When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "gratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come\n",
      "out at this late hour to call upon us.  I am afraid you must have\n",
      "had a shocking walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all, sir.  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\n",
      "that I must draw back from your great fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.  I wish you may\n",
      "not catch cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.  Not a speck on them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\n",
      "of rain here.  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\n",
      "while we were at breakfast.  I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.  Being pretty well aware\n",
      "of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry\n",
      "with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.\n",
      "How did you all behave? Who cried most?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly\n",
      "say `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma;\n",
      "but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At\n",
      "any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!\"\n",
      "said Emma playfully.  \"That is what you have in your head,\n",
      "I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "with a sigh.  \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose\n",
      "Mr. Knightley to mean _you_.  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant\n",
      "only myself.  Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--\n",
      "in a joke--it is all a joke.  We always say what we like to one another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see\n",
      "faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:\n",
      "and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,\n",
      "she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would\n",
      "not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\n",
      "thought perfect by every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I\n",
      "meant no reflection on any body.  Miss Taylor has been used\n",
      "to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.\n",
      "The chances are that she must be a gainer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass--\"you want to hear\n",
      "about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all\n",
      "behaved charmingly.  Every body was punctual, every body in their\n",
      "best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.  Oh no;\n",
      "we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,\n",
      "and were sure of meeting every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father.\n",
      "\"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,\n",
      "and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.\n",
      "\"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Knightley.  \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir,\n",
      "if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to\n",
      "Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,\n",
      "at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,\n",
      "and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,\n",
      "and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.\n",
      "Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily\n",
      "married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma,\n",
      "\"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.\n",
      "I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,\n",
      "and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would\n",
      "never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.  Her father fondly replied,\n",
      "\"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,\n",
      "for whatever you say always comes to pass.  Pray do not make any\n",
      "more matches.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,\n",
      "for other people.  It is the greatest amusement in the world! And\n",
      "after such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would\n",
      "never marry again.  Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower\n",
      "so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,\n",
      "so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\n",
      "friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--\n",
      "Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\n",
      "not like it.  Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.\n",
      "Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,\n",
      "and others of the son and the uncle not letting him.  All manner\n",
      "of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none\n",
      "of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I\n",
      "met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,\n",
      "he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas\n",
      "for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.\n",
      "I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed\n",
      "me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave\n",
      "off match-making.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not understand what you mean by `success,'\" said Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "\"Success supposes endeavour.  Your time has been properly and\n",
      "delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four\n",
      "years to bring about this marriage.  A worthy employment for a young\n",
      "lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,\n",
      "as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself\n",
      "one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor\n",
      "if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself\n",
      "every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where\n",
      "is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess;\n",
      "and _that_ is all that can be said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--\n",
      "I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky\n",
      "guess is never merely luck.  There is always some talent in it.\n",
      "And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not\n",
      "know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.  You have drawn\n",
      "two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something\n",
      "between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's\n",
      "visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed\n",
      "many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.\n",
      "I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\n",
      "unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\n",
      "own concerns.  You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,\n",
      "than good to them, by interference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\"\n",
      "rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.  \"But, my dear,\n",

      "him a service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very\n",

      "want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come\n",
      "and dine with us some day.  That will be a much better thing.\n",
      "I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "laughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much\n",
      "better thing.  Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best\n",

      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\n",
      "which for the last two or three generations had been rising into\n",
      "gentility and property.  He had received a good education, but,\n",
      "on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become\n",
      "indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\n",
      "were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social\n",
      "temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances\n",
      "of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,\n",
      "of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love\n",
      "with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,\n",
      "who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,\n",
      "which the connexion would offend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command\n",
      "of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\n",
      "family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it\n",
      "took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,\n",
      "who threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion,\n",
      "and did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found\n",
      "more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\n",
      "made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\n",
      "of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,\n",
      "she had not the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue\n",
      "her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain\n",
      "from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,\n",
      "nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.  They lived beyond\n",
      "their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:\n",
      "she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once\n",
      "to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\n",
      "as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst\n",
      "of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,\n",
      "he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\n",
      "From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.\n",
      "The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering\n",
      "illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;\n",
      "and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,\n",
      "nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to\n",
      "take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.\n",
      "Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed\n",
      "to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,\n",
      "the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,\n",
      "and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to\n",
      "improve as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "A complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia\n",
      "and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a\n",
      "good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.\n",
      "It was a concern which brought just employment enough.  He had still\n",
      "a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;\n",
      "and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,\n",
      "the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.\n",
      "He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure\n",
      "the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had\n",
      "always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even\n",
      "as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own\n",
      "friendly and social disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence\n",
      "his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\n",
      "on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling\n",
      "till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long\n",
      "looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects\n",
      "in view, till they were accomplished.  He had made his fortune,\n",
      "bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new\n",
      "period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness\n",
      "than in any yet passed through.  He had never been an unhappy man;\n",
      "his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;\n",
      "but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly\n",
      "amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof\n",
      "of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,\n",
      "to excite gratitude than to feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was\n",
      "his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought\n",
      "up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption\n",
      "as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.\n",
      "It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his\n",
      "father's assistance.  His father had no apprehension of it.\n",
      "The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;\n",
      "but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice\n",
      "could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,\n",
      "so deservedly dear.  He saw his son every year in London,\n",
      "and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\n",
      "young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.\n",
      "He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\n",
      "merits and prospects a kind of common concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\n",
      "curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\n",
      "returned that he had never been there in his life.  His coming\n",
      "to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,\n",
      "as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.\n",
      "There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when\n",
      "Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and\n",
      "Miss Bates returned the visit.  Now was the time for Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was\n",
      "understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.\n",
      "For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention\n",
      "of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.  \"I suppose you\n",
      "have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written\n",
      "to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.  Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he\n",
      "says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.  Mrs. Weston had, of course,\n",
      "formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\n",
      "attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,\n",
      "and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\n",
      "of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.  She felt\n",
      "herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough\n",
      "to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only\n",
      "regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\n",
      "for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,\n",
      "without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering\n",
      "an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear\n",
      "Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation\n",
      "than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,\n",
      "and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\n",
      "through its little difficulties and privations.  And then there was\n",
      "such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,\n",
      "so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's\n",
      "disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching\n",
      "season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\n",
      "week together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\n",
      "to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her\n",
      "satisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,\n",
      "was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,\n",
      "was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\n",
      "`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre\n",
      "of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening\n",
      "attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.\n",
      "But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,\n",
      "and saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of\n",
      "ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation\n",
      "to Mr. Woodhouse.  The compliments of his neighbours were over;\n",
      "he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;\n",
      "and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,\n",
      "was all eat up.  His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he\n",
      "could never believe other people to be different from himself.\n",
      "What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;\n",
      "and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\n",
      "any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly\n",
      "tried to prevent any body's eating it.  He had been at the pains\n",
      "of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.  Mr. Perry\n",
      "was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\n",
      "of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,\n",
      "he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the\n",
      "bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree\n",
      "with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.\n",
      "With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped\n",
      "to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the\n",
      "cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\n",
      "it was all gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys\n",
      "being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their\n",
      "hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.  He liked very much\n",
      "to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,\n",
      "from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,\n",
      "from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the\n",
      "visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.\n",
      "He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;\n",
      "his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit\n",
      "for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.\n",
      "Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,\n",
      "and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "comprehended many such.  Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,\n",
      "he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening\n",
      "parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any\n",
      "time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week\n",
      "in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;\n",
      "and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,\n",
      "the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\n",
      "for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,\n",
      "and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being\n",
      "thrown away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able\n",
      "of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies\n",
      "almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,\n",
      "and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.  Had it\n",
      "taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a\n",
      "very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.\n",
      "She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was\n",
      "considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,\n",
      "under such untoward circumstances, can excite.  Her daughter enjoyed\n",
      "a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,\n",
      "handsome, rich, nor married.  Miss Bates stood in the very worst\n",
      "predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;\n",
      "and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,\n",
      "or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.\n",
      "She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.  Her youth\n",
      "had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\n",
      "to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\n",
      "income go as far as possible.  And yet she was a happy woman,\n",
      "and a woman whom no one named without good-will.  It was her own\n",
      "universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.\n",
      "She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,\n",
      "quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate\n",
      "creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,\n",
      "and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted\n",
      "for nothing.  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,\n",
      "her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,\n",
      "and a mine of felicity to herself.  She was a great talker upon\n",
      "little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial\n",
      "communications and harmless gossip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,\n",
      "or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\n",
      "refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\n",
      "upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for\n",
      "enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but\n",
      "a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\n",
      "quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,\n",
      "and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble\n",
      "themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming\n",
      "back prodigies.  Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and\n",
      "very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\n",
      "spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty\n",
      "of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,\n",
      "and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.\n",
      "It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\n",
      "after her to church.  She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\n",
      "who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled\n",
      "to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly\n",
      "owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim\n",
      "on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,\n",
      "whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently\n",
      "able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,\n",
      "in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,\n",
      "it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.  She was delighted\n",
      "to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with\n",
      "herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings\n",
      "of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\n",
      "was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close\n",
      "of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,\n",
      "in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;\n",
      "a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,\n",
      "whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,\n",
      "on account of her beauty.  A very gracious invitation was returned,\n",
      "and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.  Somebody had\n",
      "placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,\n",
      "and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar\n",
      "to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known\n",
      "of her history.  She had no visible friends but what had been\n",
      "acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit\n",
      "in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\n",
      "which Emma particularly admired.  She was short, plump, and fair,\n",
      "with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,\n",
      "and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,\n",
      "Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite\n",
      "determined to continue the acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's\n",
      "conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\n",
      "inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\n",
      "shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\n",
      "grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly\n",
      "impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\n",
      "to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,\n",
      "and deserve encouragement.  Encouragement should be given.\n",
      "Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be\n",
      "wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.\n",
      "The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.\n",
      "The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort\n",
      "of people, must be doing her harm.  They were a family of the name\n",
      "of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm\n",
      "of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,\n",
      "she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they\n",
      "must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates\n",
      "of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\n",
      "to be quite perfect.  _She_ would notice her; she would improve her;\n",
      "she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\n",
      "into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.\n",
      "It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;\n",
      "highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking\n",
      "and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that\n",
      "the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,\n",
      "which always closed such parties, and for which she had been\n",
      "used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,\n",
      "and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.  With an\n",
      "alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\n",
      "indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,\n",
      "with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,\n",
      "did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend\n",
      "the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she\n",
      "knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.\n",
      "He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion\n",
      "of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\n",
      "made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his\n",
      "hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,\n",
      "his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that\n",
      "he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he\n",
      "might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing\n",
      "the nicer things, to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.\n",
      "An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.  Serle understands boiling\n",
      "an egg better than any body.  I would not recommend an egg boiled\n",
      "by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,\n",
      "you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.  Miss Bates,\n",
      "let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit.\n",

      "Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in\n",
      "a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had\n",
      "particular pleasure in sending them away happy.  The happiness\n",
      "of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.  Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the\n",
      "introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,\n",
      "grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,\n",

      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.\n",
      "Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\n",
      "and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,\n",
      "so did their satisfaction in each other.  As a walking companion,\n",
      "Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\n",
      "In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.  Her father\n",
      "never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground\n",
      "sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;\n",
      "and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.\n",
      "She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;\n",
      "and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any\n",
      "time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.\n",
      "But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,\n",
      "and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,\n",
      "grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring\n",
      "to be guided by any one she looked up to.  Her early attachment\n",
      "to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,\n",
      "and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that\n",
      "there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must\n",
      "not be expected.  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet\n",
      "Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the\n",
      "something which her home required.  Such a friend as Mrs. Weston\n",
      "was out of the question.  Two such could never be granted.\n",
      "Two such she did not want.  It was quite a different sort of thing,\n",
      "a sentiment distinct and independent.  Mrs. Weston was the object\n",
      "of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\n",
      "Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.\n",
      "For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\n",
      "were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.  She was ready to tell\n",
      "every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.\n",
      "Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never\n",
      "believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered\n",
      "the truth.  Harriet had no penetration.  She had been satisfied\n",
      "to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;\n",
      "and looked no farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\n",
      "school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and\n",
      "but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,\n",
      "it must have been the whole.  But the Martins occupied her thoughts\n",
      "a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\n",
      "and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\n",
      "the many comforts and wonders of the place.  Emma encouraged her\n",
      "talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\n",
      "and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\n",
      "exultation of Mrs. Martin's having \"_two_ parlours, two very good parlours,\n",
      "indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room;\n",
      "and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years\n",
      "with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,\n",
      "and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;\n",
      "and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be\n",
      "called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house\n",
      "in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink\n",
      "tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause;\n",
      "but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.\n",
      "She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,\n",
      "a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared\n",
      "that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always\n",
      "mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something\n",
      "or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,\n",
      "no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\n",
      "friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she\n",
      "were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number\n",
      "and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\n",
      "and there was evidently no dislike to it.  Harriet was very ready\n",
      "to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\n",
      "evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured\n",
      "and obliging.  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring\n",
      "her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,\n",
      "and in every thing else he was so very obliging.  He had his\n",
      "shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\n",
      "She was very fond of singing.  He could sing a little himself.\n",
      "She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.\n",
      "He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,\n",
      "he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.\n",
      "She believed every body spoke well of him.  His mother and sisters\n",
      "were very fond of him.  Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there\n",
      "was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\n",
      "to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,\n",
      "he would make a good husband.  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.\n",
      "She was in no hurry at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma.  \"You know what you are about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had\n",
      "ever seen.  Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all\n",
      "the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,\n",
      "to sup with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line\n",
      "of his own business? He does not read?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has\n",
      "read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.\n",
      "He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay\n",
      "in one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself.\n",
      "But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read\n",
      "something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.\n",
      "And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.  He never read the\n",
      "Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.  He had never\n",
      "heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined\n",
      "to get them now as soon as ever he can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question was--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.  I thought him very plain\n",
      "at first, but I do not think him so plain now.  One does not, you know,\n",
      "after a time.  But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every\n",
      "now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way\n",
      "to Kingston.  He has passed you very often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without\n",
      "having any idea of his name.  A young farmer, whether on horseback\n",
      "or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.\n",
      "The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I\n",
      "can have nothing to do.  A degree or two lower, and a creditable\n",
      "appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their\n",
      "families in some way or other.  But a farmer can need none of my help,\n",
      "and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every\n",
      "other he is below it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure.  Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have\n",
      "observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.\n",
      "I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.\n",
      "What do you imagine his age to be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is\n",
      "the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.  His mother is\n",
      "perfectly right not to be in a hurry.  They seem very comfortable\n",
      "as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,\n",
      "she would probably repent it.  Six years hence, if he could meet\n",
      "with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,\n",
      "with a little money, it might be very desirable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,\n",
      "who are not born to an independence.  Mr. Martin, I imagine,\n",
      "has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with\n",
      "the world.  Whatever money he might come into when his father died,\n",
      "whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,\n",
      "all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,\n",
      "with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to\n",
      "impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure, so it is.  But they live very comfortably.\n",
      "They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;\n",
      "and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\n",
      "marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though\n",
      "his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether\n",
      "objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit\n",
      "for you to notice.  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you\n",
      "particularly careful as to your associates.  There can be no doubt\n",
      "of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your\n",
      "claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there\n",
      "will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.  But while I visit\n",
      "at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "I am not afraid of what any body can do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\n",
      "would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\n",
      "independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.  I want to see you\n",
      "permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable\n",
      "to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say\n",
      "that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,\n",
      "I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,\n",
      "to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere\n",
      "farmer's daughter, without education.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure.  Yes.  Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\n",
      "but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.\n",
      "However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I\n",
      "am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.  I shall\n",
      "always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,\n",
      "and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well\n",
      "educated as me.  But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,\n",
      "certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,\n",
      "and saw no alarming symptoms of love.  The young man had been\n",
      "the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,\n",
      "and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side,\n",
      "to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\n",
      "Donwell road.  He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully\n",
      "at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.\n",
      "Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;\n",
      "and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made\n",
      "her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.\n",
      "His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,\n",
      "but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be\n",
      "contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground\n",
      "he had gained in Harriet's inclination.  Harriet was not insensible\n",
      "of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness\n",
      "with admiration as well as wonder.  Mr. Martin looked as if he\n",
      "did not know what manner was.\n",
      "\n",
      "They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must\n",
      "not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a\n",
      "smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "hoped very soon to compose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was\n",
      "quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.\n",
      "He did not think we ever walked this road.  He thought we walked\n",
      "towards Randalls most days.  He has not been able to get the\n",
      "Romance of the Forest yet.  He was so busy the last time he was\n",
      "at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.\n",
      "So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he\n",
      "like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him\n",
      "so very plain?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is\n",
      "nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.  I had no\n",
      "right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no\n",
      "idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.\n",
      "I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not\n",
      "so genteel as real gentlemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\n",
      "repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,\n",
      "that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.\n",
      "At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,\n",
      "well bred men.  I should be surprized if, after seeing them,\n",
      "you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving\n",
      "him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at\n",
      "yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.\n",
      "Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure\n",
      "you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,\n",
      "and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated\n",
      "as I stood here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.  He has not such a fine\n",
      "air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.  I see the difference\n",
      "plain enough.  But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair\n",
      "to compare Mr. Martin with _him_.  You might not see one in a hundred\n",
      "with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.  But he is\n",
      "not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.  What say you\n",
      "to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_.\n",
      "Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;\n",
      "of being silent.  You must see the difference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.  But Mr. Weston is almost\n",
      "an old man.  Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.  The older a\n",
      "person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners\n",
      "should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,\n",
      "or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.  What is passable in youth\n",
      "is detestable in later age.  Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;\n",
      "what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there may be pretty good guessing.  He will be a completely gross,\n",
      "vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking\n",
      "of nothing but profit and loss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\n",
      "circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\n",
      "He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\n",
      "else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.  What has\n",
      "he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive,\n",
      "and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse\n",
      "need not disturb _us_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"--was all Harriet's answer,\n",
      "and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might\n",
      "be safely left to itself.  She, therefore, said no more for some time.\n",
      "Her next beginning was,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior\n",
      "to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness.\n",
      "They might be more safely held up as a pattern.  There is an openness,\n",
      "a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body\n",
      "likes in _him_, because there is so much good-humour with it--but\n",
      "that would not do to be copied.  Neither would Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits\n",
      "_him_ very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem\n",
      "to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,\n",
      "he would not be sufferable.  On the contrary, I think a young man\n",
      "might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.\n",
      "Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\n",
      "He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.  I do not\n",
      "know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either\n",
      "of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his\n",
      "manners are softer than they used to be.  If he means any thing,\n",
      "it must be to please you.  Did not I tell you what he said of you\n",
      "the other day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn\n",
      "from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed\n",
      "and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving\n",
      "the young farmer out of Harriet's head.  She thought it would\n",
      "be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,\n",
      "and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.\n",
      "She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.\n",
      "It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled\n",
      "her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during\n",
      "the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.  The longer\n",
      "she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.\n",
      "Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,\n",
      "and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family\n",
      "that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.  He had a\n",
      "comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;\n",
      "for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\n",
      "to have some independent property; and she thought very highly\n",
      "of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,\n",
      "without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\n",
      "girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,\n",
      "was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be\n",
      "little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all\n",
      "the usual weight and efficacy.  And he was really a very pleasing\n",
      "young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.\n",
      "He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,\n",
      "though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which\n",
      "she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified\n",
      "by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts\n",
      "for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"of\n",
      "this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her\n",
      "with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.\n",
      "I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.\n",
      "How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any\n",
      "good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels\n",
      "about Emma, Mr. Knightley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,\n",
      "knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,\n",
      "for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.  We were speaking\n",
      "of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,\n",
      "that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.\n",
      "You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value\n",
      "of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort\n",
      "a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used\n",
      "to it all her life.  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.\n",
      "She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be.\n",
      "But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,\n",
      "it will be an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will\n",
      "read together.  She means it, I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve\n",
      "years old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at\n",
      "various times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and\n",
      "very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly\n",
      "arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.\n",
      "The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it\n",
      "did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;\n",
      "and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.  But I\n",
      "have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.\n",
      "She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,\n",
      "and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor\n",
      "failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do\n",
      "nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you\n",
      "wished.--You know you could not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought\n",
      "so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's\n",
      "omitting to do any thing I wished.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\"--said\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.  \"But I,\"\n",
      "he soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,\n",
      "must still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the\n",
      "cleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the misfortune of\n",
      "being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.\n",
      "She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.\n",
      "And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house\n",
      "and of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope\n",
      "with her.  She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been\n",
      "under subjection to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on\n",
      "_your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted\n",
      "another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for\n",
      "me to any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said he, smiling.  \"You are better placed _here_; very fit\n",
      "for a wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing\n",
      "yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.\n",
      "You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would\n",
      "seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_,\n",
      "on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,\n",
      "and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend\n",
      "him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife\n",
      "to such a man as Mr. Weston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,\n",
      "and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing\n",
      "to be borne.  We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross\n",
      "from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not\n",
      "foretell vexation from that quarter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma's\n",
      "genius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart,\n",
      "the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\n",
      "Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think\n",
      "her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.\n",
      "She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.\n",
      "She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,\n",
      "because undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can\n",
      "Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet\n",
      "is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,\n",
      "I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance.\n",
      "Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places\n",
      "she belongs to.  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable\n",
      "with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.\n",
      "I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind,\n",
      "or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties\n",
      "of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\n",
      "anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\n",
      "How well she looked last night!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?\n",
      "Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer\n",
      "perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have\n",
      "seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.\n",
      "But I am a partial old friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\n",
      "open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\n",
      "and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\n",
      "There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,\n",
      "her glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture\n",
      "of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete\n",
      "picture of grown-up health.  She is loveliness itself.  Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "is not she?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied.\n",
      "\"I think her all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I\n",
      "will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.\n",
      "Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little\n",
      "occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am\n",
      "not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread\n",
      "of its doing them both harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its\n",
      "not doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma's little faults,\n",
      "she is an excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter,\n",
      "or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities\n",
      "which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;\n",
      "she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the\n",
      "right a hundred times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; I will not plague you any more.  Emma shall be an angel,\n",
      "and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John\n",
      "and Isabella.  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore\n",
      "not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;\n",
      "except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.\n",
      "I am sure of having their opinions with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\n",
      "but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\n",
      "you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's\n",
      "mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think\n",
      "any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made\n",
      "a matter of much discussion among you.  Pray excuse me; but supposing\n",
      "any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,\n",
      "it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,\n",
      "who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,\n",
      "so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.  It has been so\n",
      "many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" cried he; \"I am much obliged to you for it.\n",
      "It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your\n",
      "advice has often found; for it shall be attended to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy\n",
      "about her sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be satisfied,\" said he, \"I will not raise any outcry.  I will keep\n",
      "my ill-humour to myself.  I have a very sincere interest in Emma.\n",
      "Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a\n",
      "greater interest; perhaps hardly so great.  There is an anxiety,\n",
      "a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.  I wonder what will become\n",
      "of her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I,\" said Mrs. Weston gently, \"very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,\n",
      "means just nothing at all.  But I have no idea that she has yet\n",
      "ever seen a man she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her\n",
      "to be very much in love with a proper object.  I should like to see\n",
      "Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.\n",
      "But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom\n",
      "from home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break\n",
      "her resolution at present,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"as can well be;\n",
      "and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be\n",
      "forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties\n",
      "on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.  I do not recommend matrimony\n",

      "There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it\n",
      "was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition\n",
      "which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to \"What does Weston\n",

      "Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy\n",
      "a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity\n",
      "to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible\n",
      "than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most\n",
      "agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up\n",
      "the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon\n",
      "pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side,\n",
      "as there could be any occasion for.  She was quite convinced\n",
      "of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love,\n",
      "if not in love already.  She had no scruple with regard to him.\n",
      "He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\n",
      "not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.\n",
      "His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner,\n",
      "since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\" said he;\n",
      "\"you have made her graceful and easy.  She was a beautiful creature\n",

      "added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet\n",
      "only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.\n",
      "She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness\n",
      "in herself.  I have done very little.\"\n",

      "You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had\n",
      "a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of\n",
      "my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.\n",
      "But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.\n",
      "But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.\n",
      "It would be such a delight to have her picture!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a\n",
      "talent in favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are.\n",
      "How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in\n",
      "specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston\n",
      "some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\n",
      "likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.  Don't pretend to be\n",
      "in raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.\n",
      "\"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe\n",
      "I shall try what I can do.  Harriet's features are very delicate,\n",
      "which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity\n",
      "in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought\n",
      "to catch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I\n",
      "have not a doubt of your success.  Pray, pray attempt it.\n",
      "As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,\n",
      "be an exquisite possession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.\n",
      "She thinks so little of her own beauty.  Did not you observe her\n",
      "manner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my\n",
      "picture be drawn?'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.  It was not lost on me.\n",
      "But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\n",
      "and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest\n",
      "pressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work directly,\n",
      "and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts\n",
      "at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they\n",
      "might decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many\n",
      "beginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\n",
      "pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.\n",
      "She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress\n",
      "both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little\n",
      "labour as she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew\n",
      "in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;\n",
      "and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\n",
      "would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.\n",
      "She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\n",
      "or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,\n",
      "or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\n",
      "than it deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most;\n",
      "her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\n",
      "been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\n",
      "would have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A likeness\n",
      "pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma.  \"I had only my\n",
      "own family to study from.  There is my father--another of my\n",
      "father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,\n",
      "that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very\n",
      "like therefore.  Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.\n",
      "Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.\n",
      "She would sit whenever I asked her.  There is my sister; and really\n",
      "quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.\n",
      "I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have\n",
      "sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four\n",
      "children that she would not be quiet.  Then, here come all my\n",
      "attempts at three of those four children;--there they are,\n",
      "Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,\n",
      "and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so\n",
      "eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no\n",
      "making children of three or four years old stand still you know;\n",
      "nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the\n",

      "who was a baby.  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it\n",
      "is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.\n",
      "He had nestled down his head most conveniently.  That's very like.\n",
      "I am rather proud of little George.  The corner of the sofa is very good.\n",
      "Then here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\n",
      "in small size, whole-length--\"my last and my best--my brother,\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I\n",
      "put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.\n",
      "I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I\n",
      "had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I\n",
      "were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too\n",
      "flattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after\n",
      "all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--\"Yes,\n",
      "it was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.\"\n",
      "We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.\n",
      "It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I\n",
      "could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised\n",
      "over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in\n",
      "Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing\n",
      "any body again.  But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own,\n",
      "and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_,\n",
      "I will break my resolution now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,\n",
      "and was repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present\n",
      "indeed, as you observe.  Exactly so.  No husbands and wives,\"\n",
      "with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider\n",
      "whether she had not better leave them together at once.  But as she\n",
      "wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.\n",
      "It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself,\n",
      "to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid\n",
      "of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet\n",
      "mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.\n",
      "But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind\n",
      "her and watching every touch.  She gave him credit for stationing\n",
      "himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;\n",
      "but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to\n",
      "place himself elsewhere.  It then occurred to her to employ him\n",
      "in reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\n",
      "indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\n",
      "the irksomeness of Miss Smith's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was only too happy.  Harriet listened, and Emma drew\n",
      "in peace.  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look;\n",
      "any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;\n",
      "and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,\n",
      "to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no\n",
      "being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration\n",
      "made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.\n",
      "She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance\n",
      "were unexceptionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite\n",
      "enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.\n",
      "There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,\n",
      "and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,\n",
      "to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had\n",
      "great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,\n",
      "and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a\n",
      "standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,\n",
      "and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations\n",
      "as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\n",
      "entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means.  We shall be most happy to consider you as one\n",
      "of the party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\n",
      "took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress\n",
      "of the picture, which was rapid and happy.  Every body who saw it\n",
      "was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended\n",
      "it through every criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\n",
      "wanted,\"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting\n",
      "that she was addressing a lover.--\"The expression of the eye is\n",
      "most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.\n",
      "It is the fault of her face that she has them not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?\" replied he.  \"I cannot agree with you.\n",
      "It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.\n",
      "I never saw such a likeness in my life.  We must allow for the effect\n",
      "of shade, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.  Consider,\n",
      "she is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which\n",
      "in short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must\n",
      "be preserved, you know.  Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it\n",
      "gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very pretty,\" said Mr. Woodhouse.  \"So prettily done! Just\n",
      "as your drawings always are, my dear.  I do not know any body who draws\n",
      "so well as you do.  The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,\n",
      "that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl\n",
      "over her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\n",
      "Look at the tree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess\n",
      "that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss\n",
      "Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable\n",
      "spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character.\n",
      "The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is\n",
      "most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.  I never saw such\n",
      "a likeness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\n",
      "few difficulties.  It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\n",
      "the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\n",
      "could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\n",
      "must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs\n",
      "of December.  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,\n",
      "than it was removed.  His gallantry was always on the alert.\n",
      "\"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure\n",
      "should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.\n",
      "It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being\n",
      "employed on such an errand.\"\n",

      "on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and\n",
      "a very few minutes settled the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,\n",
      "and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it\n",
      "as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he\n",
      "seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he\n",
      "received it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\" thought Emma.\n",
      "\"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different\n",
      "ways of being in love.  He is an excellent young man, and will suit\n",
      "Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself;\n",
      "but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more\n",
      "than I could endure as a principal.  I come in for a pretty good\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion\n",
      "for Emma's services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,\n",
      "as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home\n",
      "to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\n",
      "talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\n",
      "extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.\n",
      "Half a minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got\n",
      "back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,\n",
      "and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left\n",
      "a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;\n",
      "and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two\n",
      "songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;\n",
      "and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct\n",
      "proposal of marriage.  \"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized\n",
      "she did not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;\n",
      "and a very good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote\n",
      "as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,\n",
      "she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she\n",
      "should do.--\" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so\n",
      "pleased and so doubtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" she cried, \"the young man is determined not to lose\n",
      "any thing for want of asking.  He will connect himself well if he can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you read the letter?\" cried Harriet.  \"Pray do.  I'd rather\n",
      "you would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized.\n",
      "The style of the letter was much above her expectation.\n",
      "There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it\n",
      "would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,\n",
      "was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much\n",
      "to the credit of the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense,\n",
      "warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.\n",
      "She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for\n",
      "her opinion, with a \"Well, well,\" and was at last forced to add,\n",
      "\"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so\n",
      "good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of\n",
      "his sisters must have helped him.  I can hardly imagine the young\n",
      "man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself\n",
      "so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the\n",
      "style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;\n",
      "not diffuse enough for a woman.  No doubt he is a sensible man,\n",
      "and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and\n",
      "clearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find\n",
      "proper words.  It is so with some men.  Yes, I understand the sort\n",
      "of mind.  Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,\n",
      "not coarse.  A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)\n",
      "than I had expected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the still waiting Harriet;--\"well--and--and what\n",
      "shall I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard\n",
      "to this letter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.  You will\n",
      "express yourself very properly, I am sure.  There is no danger of your\n",
      "not being intelligible, which is the first thing.  Your meaning must\n",
      "be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\n",
      "and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,\n",
      "will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded.\n",
      "You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow\n",
      "for his disappointment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you\n",
      "in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I\n",
      "have been under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding\n",
      "you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.\n",
      "I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was silent.  With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would\n",
      "you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I\n",
      "ought to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.  I will have nothing to\n",
      "do with it.  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\n",
      "contemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered\n",
      "in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery\n",
      "of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_\n",
      "as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought\n",
      "to refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say\n",
      "`No' directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into\n",
      "with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty\n",
      "as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you.\n",
      "But do not imagine that I want to influence you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you\n",
      "would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean\n",
      "that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should\n",
      "not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer\n",
      "to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not for the world,\" said Emma, smiling graciously, \"would I advise\n",
      "you either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness.\n",
      "If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him\n",
      "the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should\n",
      "you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you\n",
      "at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not\n",
      "deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.\n",
      "At this moment whom are you thinking of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned\n",
      "away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though\n",
      "the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted\n",
      "about without regard.  Emma waited the result with impatience,\n",
      "but not without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation,\n",
      "Harriet said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must\n",
      "do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,\n",
      "and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.  Do you\n",
      "think I am right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\n",
      "what you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings\n",
      "to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no\n",
      "hesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.\n",
      "It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have\n",
      "been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in\n",
      "the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would\n",
      "not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.\n",
      "I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.\n",
      "Now I am secure of you for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck\n",
      "her forcibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You could not have visited me!\" she cried, looking aghast.\n",
      "\"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.\n",
      "That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you\n",
      "for any thing in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;\n",
      "but it must have been.  You would have thrown yourself out of all\n",
      "good society.  I must have given you up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed\n",
      "me never to come to Hartfield any more!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\n",
      "confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!\n",
      "I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.\n",
      "He must have a pretty good opinion of himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not think he is conceited either, in general,\" said Harriet,\n",
      "her conscience opposing such censure; \"at least, he is very good natured,\n",
      "and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\n",
      "for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,\n",
      "though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and\n",
      "certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen\n",
      "people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,\n",
      "there is no comparison at all, _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable.\n",
      "However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,\n",
      "and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached\n",
      "to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,\n",
      "it is what I would not do upon any consideration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.  We will not\n",
      "be parted.  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked,\n",
      "or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a\n",
      "\"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the\n",
      "clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,\n",
      "to know that her husband could write a good letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, very.  Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\n",
      "happy with pleasant companions.  I am quite determined to refuse him.\n",
      "But how shall I do? What shall I say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,\n",
      "and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,\n",
      "in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest\n",
      "against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the\n",
      "formation of every sentence.  The looking over his letter again,\n",
      "in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was\n",
      "particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;\n",
      "and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,\n",
      "and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,\n",
      "and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,\n",
      "that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,\n",
      "he would have been accepted after all.\n",

      "would appear valuable in her eyes.  As to any thing superior for you,\n",
      "I suppose she is quite in the dark.  The attentions of a certain\n",

      "Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.  For some weeks past she\n",
      "had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually\n",
      "getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma\n",
      "judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her\n",
      "with them as much as possible just at present.  She was obliged\n",
      "to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's,\n",
      "but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,\n",
      "to make a regular visit of some days.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up\n",
      "his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,\n",
      "and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples\n",
      "of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering\n",
      "by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted\n",
      "apologies and civil hesitations of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you\n",
      "will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take\n",
      "Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.  As the sun\n",
      "is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.\n",
      "I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.  We invalids think we\n",
      "are privileged people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.  Emma will be happy\n",
      "to entertain you.  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse\n",
      "and take my three turns--my winter walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot do better, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;\n",
      "and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I\n",
      "think the sooner _you_ go the better.  I will fetch your greatcoat\n",
      "and open the garden door for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\n",
      "immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined\n",
      "for more chat.  He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking\n",
      "of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\" said he; \"but she is a\n",
      "pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of\n",
      "her disposition.  Her character depends upon those she is with;\n",
      "but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come,\" said he, \"you are anxious for a compliment, so I will\n",
      "tell you that you have improved her.  You have cured her of her\n",
      "school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I\n",
      "had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow\n",
      "praise where they may.  _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Almost every moment.  She has been gone longer already than\n",
      "she intended.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore\n",
      "said nothing.  He presently added, with a smile,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you\n",
      "that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon\n",
      "hear of something to her advantage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! how so? of what sort?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very serious sort, I assure you;\" still smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love\n",
      "with her? Who makes you their confidant?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will\n",
      "soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\n",
      "quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.  Her visit to Abbey-Mill,\n",
      "this summer, seems to have done his business.  He is desperately\n",
      "in love and means to marry her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet\n",
      "means to marry him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came\n",
      "to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.\n",
      "He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,\n",
      "I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask\n",
      "me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;\n",
      "whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his\n",
      "choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being\n",
      "considered (especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line\n",
      "of society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said.\n",
      "I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.\n",
      "He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very\n",
      "well judging.  He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,\n",
      "and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is\n",
      "an excellent young man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation\n",
      "in advising him to marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it;\n",
      "and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.\n",
      "I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.\n",
      "If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought\n",
      "highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the\n",
      "best friend and counsellor man ever had.  This happened the night\n",
      "before last.  Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\n",
      "much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\n",
      "appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should\n",
      "be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,\n",
      "without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\n",
      "through a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\n",
      "did not speak yesterday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it;\n",
      "but it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what\n",
      "you have told me.  He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,\n",
      "and was refused.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;\n",
      "and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,\n",
      "as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.\n",
      "What is the foolish girl about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible\n",
      "to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.\n",
      "A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is\n",
      "the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,\n",
      "if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.  Emma, this is\n",
      "your doing.  You persuaded her to refuse him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should\n",
      "not feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable\n",
      "young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am\n",
      "rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.\n",
      "By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.  It is\n",
      "a pity that they were ever got over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not Harriet's equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;\n",
      "and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he\n",
      "is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense\n",
      "as in situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.\n",
      "What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,\n",
      "to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural\n",
      "daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision\n",
      "at all, and certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only\n",
      "as parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl,\n",
      "nor a girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful,\n",
      "and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.\n",
      "At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,\n",
      "is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.\n",
      "She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.\n",
      "My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being\n",
      "beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.  I felt that,\n",
      "as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\n",
      "to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.\n",
      "But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing\n",
      "to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort\n",
      "of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led\n",
      "aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt\n",
      "to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)\n",
      "that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.\n",
      "Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately\n",
      "that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the\n",
      "sake of her being settled so well.  I remember saying to myself,\n",
      "`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a\n",
      "good match.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\n",
      "any such thing.  What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\n",
      "his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\n",
      "friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying\n",
      "a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I\n",
      "wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.\n",
      "I assure you mine are very different.  I must think your statement\n",
      "by no means fair.  You are not just to Harriet's claims.\n",
      "They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;\n",
      "Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly\n",
      "her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves\n",
      "is much above his.--It would be a degradation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married\n",
      "to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense\n",
      "she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.\n",
      "She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below\n",
      "the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely\n",
      "be a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of\n",
      "fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged\n",
      "for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter,\n",
      "is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,\n",
      "no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may\n",
      "have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part\n",
      "of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\n",
      "After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,\n",
      "in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance.\n",
      "Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_\n",
      "good enough.  She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose\n",
      "to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,\n",
      "nor any ambition beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the\n",
      "Martins in the summer.  She had no sense of superiority then.\n",
      "If she has it now, you have given it.  You have been no friend to\n",
      "Harriet Smith, Emma.  Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far,\n",
      "if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.\n",
      "I know him well.  He has too much real feeling to address any\n",
      "woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.  And as to conceit,\n",
      "he is the farthest from it of any man I know.  Depend upon it he\n",
      "had encouragement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\n",
      "assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\n",
      "are unjust to Harriet.  Harriet's claims to marry well are not\n",
      "so contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl,\n",
      "but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not\n",
      "deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.\n",
      "Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you\n",
      "describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in\n",
      "the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations\n",
      "to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,\n",
      "and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;\n",
      "and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject\n",
      "of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\n",
      "in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,\n",
      "with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired\n",
      "and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,\n",
      "consequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is not so very\n",
      "slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness\n",
      "of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great\n",
      "readiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much mistaken\n",
      "if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,\n",
      "the highest claims a woman could possess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,\n",
      "is almost enough to make me think so too.  Better be without sense,\n",
      "than misapply it as you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully.  \"I know _that_ is the feeling\n",
      "of you all.  I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly\n",
      "what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses\n",
      "and satisfies his judgment.  Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.\n",
      "Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.\n",
      "And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning\n",
      "to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first\n",
      "offer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr. Knightley\n",
      "presently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\n",
      "perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.\n",
      "You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what\n",
      "she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her\n",
      "reach will be good enough for her.  Vanity working on a weak head,\n",
      "produces every sort of mischief.  Nothing so easy as for a young lady\n",
      "to raise her expectations too high.  Miss Harriet Smith may not find\n",
      "offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.\n",
      "Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.\n",
      "Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves\n",
      "with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be\n",
      "afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,\n",
      "when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry\n",
      "Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;\n",
      "but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach\n",
      "her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence\n",
      "and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "all the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a\n",
      "girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,\n",
      "and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "that there can be no use in canvassing it.  We shall only be making\n",
      "each other more angry.  But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin,\n",
      "it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,\n",

      "but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.\n",
      "His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,\n",
      "that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.\n",
      "I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,\n",
      "she might tolerate him.  He was the brother of her friends,\n",
      "and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\n",
      "nobody better (that must have been his great assistant)\n",
      "she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.\n",
      "But the case is altered now.  She knows now what gentlemen are;\n",

      "She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself\n",
      "a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he\n",
      "could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment\n",
      "in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;\n",
      "and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,\n",
      "was very disagreeable.  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence,\n",
      "with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather,\n",

      "of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,\n",
      "and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you\n",
      "that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain.\"\n",

      "\n",

      "and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely\n",
      "to make an imprudent match.  He knows the value of a good income\n",
      "as well as any body.  Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will\n",
      "act rationally.  He is as well acquainted with his own claims, as you\n",
      "can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,\n",
      "and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way\n",
      "of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,\n",
      "I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.\n",
      "I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family\n",
      "of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all\n",
      "twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again.\n",
      "\"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would\n",
      "have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want\n",
      "to keep Harriet to myself.  I have done with match-making indeed.\n",
      "I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.  I shall leave\n",
      "off while I am well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning to you,\"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.\n",
      "He was very much vexed.  He felt the disappointment of the young man,\n",
      "and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the\n",
      "sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had\n",
      "taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\n",
      "indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.  She did not always\n",
      "feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\n",
      "her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.\n",
      "She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little\n",
      "time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.\n",
      "Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.\n",
      "The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,\n",
      "gave alarming ideas.  The dread of such a failure after all became the\n",
      "prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,\n",
      "and without having any such reason to give for her long absence,\n",
      "she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,\n",
      "and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,\n",
      "she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings\n",
      "would not justify.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\n",
      "that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,\n",
      "neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,\n",
      "in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such\n",
      "an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it\n",
      "hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather\n",
      "said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew\n",
      "any thing about.  He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak\n",
      "with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not\n",
      "be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;\n",
      "he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;\n",
      "but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence\n",
      "of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley\n",
      "saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;\n",
      "but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\n",
      "hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;\n",
      "and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very\n",
      "sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,\n",
      "not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash\n",
      "had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately\n",
      "with great delight.  Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend\n",
      "a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,\n",
      "that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met\n",

      "actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till\n",
      "the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been\n",
      "never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him\n",
      "about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,\n",
      "to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off\n",
      "his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been\n",
      "determined to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed,\n",
      "that he was going on business which he would not put off for any\n",
      "inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,\n",
      "and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.  Mr. Perry\n",
      "could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must\n",
      "be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only\n",
      "looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\n",
      "Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more\n",
      "about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\n",
      "\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,\n",
      "but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,\n",

      "Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel\n",
      "with herself.  He was so much displeased, that it was longer than\n",
      "usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,\n",
      "his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.  She was sorry,\n",
      "but could not repent.  On the contrary, her plans and proceedings\n",

      "Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\n",
      "sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\n",
      "of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were\n",
      "visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment\n",
      "as her youth and sort of mind admitted.  Emma was soon perfectly\n",
      "satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as\n",
      "he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal\n",
      "of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than\n",
      "a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.\n",
      "It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let\n",
      "her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be\n",
      "labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;\n",
      "and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,\n",
      "the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,\n",
      "was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort\n",
      "that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,\n",
      "made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale\n",
      "are not uncommon.  Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,\n",
      "had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken\n",
      "the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,\n",
      "to get a great many more.  Emma assisted with her invention,\n",
      "memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,\n",
      "it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form\n",
      "as well as quantity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,\n",
      "and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.\n",
      "\"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\n",
      "wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\"\n",
      "And it always ended in \"Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\n",
      "did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;\n",
      "but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about\n",
      "so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of\n",
      "Highbury in general should be put under requisition.  Mr. Elton\n",
      "was the only one whose assistance she asked.  He was invited\n",
      "to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums\n",
      "that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him\n",
      "most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,\n",
      "as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,\n",
      "nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass\n",
      "his lips.  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;\n",
      "and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,\n",

      "The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.\n",

      "table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had\n",
      "addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,\n",

      "\n",
      "The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma\n",

      "of Mr. Elton.  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,\n",
      "and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,\n",
      "an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it\n",
      "could be.  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much\n",
      "smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,\n",
      "there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without\n",

      "Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,\n",

      "and I do not think I ever shall.  And, without love, I am sure I\n",
      "should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.  Fortune I\n",
      "do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want:\n",
      "I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their\n",
      "husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect\n",
      "to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\n",
      "thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--\n",
      "so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--\n",
      "and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,\n",
      "I would marry to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never\n",
      "can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is\n",
      "poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!\n",
      "A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,\n",
      "disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,\n",
      "but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,\n",
      "and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.  And the\n",
      "distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common\n",
      "sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income\n",
      "has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\n",
      "Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,\n",
      "and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.\n",
      "This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good\n",
      "natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\n",
      "much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.\n",
      "Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:  I really believe,\n",
      "if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely\n",
      "to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:  that is a\n",

      "\n",

      "many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be\n",
      "more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.\n",
      "Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then\n",
      "as they are now; or with no important variation.  If I draw less,\n",
      "I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.\n",
      "And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,\n",
      "which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which\n",
      "is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall\n",
      "be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,\n",
      "to care about.  There will be enough of them, in all probability,\n",
      "to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.\n",
      "There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my\n",
      "attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas\n",
      "of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.  My nephews\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes\n",
      "to Highbury.  By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out\n",
      "of conceit with a niece.  Heaven forbid! at least, that I should\n",
      "ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,\n",
      "as she does about Jane Fairfax.  One is sick of the very name\n",
      "of Jane Fairfax.  Every letter from her is read forty times over;\n",
      "her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she\n",
      "does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair\n",
      "of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.\n",
      "I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics\n",
      "were superseded.  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses\n",
      "of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention\n",
      "and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.\n",
      "She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and\n",
      "their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary\n",
      "virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into\n",
      "their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance\n",
      "with as much intelligence as good-will.  In the present instance,\n",
      "it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;\n",
      "and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,\n",
      "she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\n",

      "\n",
      "\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.  How trifling they\n",
      "make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of\n",
      "nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,\n",
      "who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true,\" said Harriet.  \"Poor creatures! one can think\n",
      "of nothing else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\"\n",
      "said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep\n",
      "which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,\n",
      "and brought them into the lane again.  \"I do not think it will,\"\n",
      "stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,\n",
      "and recall the still greater within.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear, no,\" said her companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked on.  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend\n",
      "was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near\n",
      "as to give Emma time only to say farther,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability\n",
      "in good thoughts.  Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that\n",
      "if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,\n",
      "it has done all that is truly important.  If we feel for the wretched,\n",
      "enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,\n",
      "only distressing to ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet could just answer, \"Oh! dear, yes,\" before the gentleman\n",
      "joined them.  The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,\n",
      "were the first subject on meeting.  He had been going to call\n",
      "on them.  His visit he would now defer; but they had a very\n",
      "interesting parley about what could be done and should be done.\n",
      "Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;\n",
      "\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\n",
      "of love on each side.  I should not wonder if it were to bring\n",
      "on the declaration.  It must, if I were not here.  I wish I were\n",
      "anywhere else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\n",
      "afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised\n",
      "on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.\n",
      "But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's\n",
      "habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,\n",
      "in short, they would both be soon after her.  This would not do;\n",
      "she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration\n",
      "to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete\n",
      "occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on,\n",
      "and she would follow in half a minute.  They did as they were desired;\n",
      "and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,\n",
      "she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken\n",
      "by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,\n",
      "with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.  To walk by the side\n",
      "of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural\n",
      "thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been\n",
      "acting just then without design; and by this means the others were\n",
      "still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.\n",
      "She gained on them, however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick,\n",
      "and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,\n",
      "from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.\n",
      "Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very\n",
      "pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning\n",
      "to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both\n",
      "looked around, and she was obliged to join them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\n",
      "and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\n",
      "was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's\n",
      "party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for\n",
      "the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,\n",
      "the beet-root, and all the dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\n",
      "consoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love;\n",
      "and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.\n",
      "If I could but have kept longer away!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\n",
      "pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into\n",
      "the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\n",
      "and fall behind to arrange it once more.  She then broke the lace\n",
      "off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently\n",
      "obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to\n",
      "put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am\n",
      "to contrive.  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,\n",
      "but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg\n",
      "leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit\n",
      "of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing\n",
      "could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\n",
      "his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.\n",
      "The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,\n",
      "and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately\n",
      "communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed\n",
      "into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most\n",
      "comfortable manner.  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she\n",
      "found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.\n",
      "It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging\n",
      "the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it\n",
      "practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.\n",
      "For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.  It could\n",
      "be protracted no longer.  She was then obliged to be finished,\n",
      "and make her appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.  It had a\n",
      "most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory\n",
      "of having schemed successfully.  But it would not do; he had not\n",
      "come to the point.  He had been most agreeable, most delightful;\n",
      "he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely\n",
      "followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,\n",
      "but nothing serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch,\n",
      "and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished\n",
      "by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself\n",
      "that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,\n",
      "and must be leading them forward to the great event.\n",

      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton must now be left to himself.  It was no longer in Emma's\n",
      "power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.\n",
      "The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand,\n",
      "that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth\n",
      "her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay\n",
      "at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--\n",
      "that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could\n",
      "be afforded by her to the lovers.  They might advance rapidly\n",
      "if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether\n",
      "they would or no.  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.\n",
      "There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will\n",
      "do for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual\n",
      "absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the\n",
      "usual interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their\n",
      "marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;\n",
      "but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing\n",
      "for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had\n",
      "been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all\n",
      "by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,\n",
      "even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most\n",
      "nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a\n",
      "little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to\n",
      "bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms\n",
      "were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,\n",
      "and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent\n",
      "number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.\n",
      "The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,\n",
      "welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,\n",
      "produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne\n",
      "under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;\n",
      "but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were\n",
      "so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\n",
      "solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,\n",
      "and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,\n",
      "all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\n",
      "which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,\n",
      "the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,\n",
      "either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\n",
      "quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\n",
      "wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,\n",
      "and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for\n",
      "these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.\n",
      "She could never see a fault in any of them.  She was not a woman\n",
      "of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance\n",
      "of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;\n",
      "was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,\n",
      "had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield\n",
      "in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.  They were alike too,\n",
      "in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard\n",
      "for every old acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\n",
      "rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his\n",
      "private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\n",
      "generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.\n",
      "He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross\n",
      "as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his\n",
      "great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,\n",
      "it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not\n",
      "be increased.  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.\n",
      "He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,\n",
      "and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing\n",
      "wrong in him escaped her.  She was quick in feeling the little\n",
      "injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.\n",
      "Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been\n",
      "flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly\n",
      "kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;\n",
      "but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her\n",
      "regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes\n",
      "fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.\n",
      "There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking\n",
      "him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.\n",
      "It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great\n",
      "regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was\n",
      "due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as\n",
      "there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,\n",
      "though the offence came not.  The beginning, however, of every visit\n",
      "displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity\n",
      "so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\n",
      "They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's\n",
      "attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my dear,\" said he, \"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes, sir,\" cried she with ready sympathy, \"how you must\n",
      "miss her!  And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--\n",
      "I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could\n",
      "possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope\n",
      "she is pretty well, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know\n",
      "but that the place agrees with her tolerably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\n",
      "doubts of the air of Randalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no--none in the least.  I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--\n",
      "never looking so well.  Papa is only speaking his own regret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very much to the honour of both,\" was the handsome reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\" asked Isabella\n",
      "in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since\n",
      "they married.  Either in the morning or evening of every day,\n",
      "excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you\n",
      "may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.  They are very,\n",
      "very kind in their visits.  Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.\n",
      "Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving\n",
      "Isabella a false idea of us all.  Every body must be aware that Miss\n",
      "Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured\n",
      "that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any\n",
      "means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped\n",
      "it was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could\n",
      "not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\n",
      "all easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea\n",
      "of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;\n",
      "and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse--\"yes, certainly--I cannot deny\n",
      "that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--\n",
      "but then--she is always obliged to go away again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--\n",
      "You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston\n",
      "has some little claim.  You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part\n",
      "of the poor husband.  I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,\n",
      "the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.\n",
      "As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience\n",
      "of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\n",
      "\"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,\n",
      "a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been\n",
      "for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought\n",
      "of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;\n",
      "and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think\n",
      "there is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the\n",
      "very best-tempered men that ever existed.  Excepting yourself\n",
      "and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.  I shall\n",
      "never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day\n",
      "last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September\n",
      "twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,\n",
      "on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,\n",
      "I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor\n",
      "a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be\n",
      "Miss Taylor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley.  \"Has he been here\n",
      "on this occasion--or has he not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma.  \"There was a strong\n",
      "expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended\n",
      "in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father.\n",
      "\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,\n",
      "and a very proper, handsome letter it was.  She shewed it to me.\n",
      "I thought it very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea\n",
      "you know, one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--\n",
      "and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!  Well,\n",
      "time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.  However, it was\n",
      "an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "a great deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth,\n",
      "and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget\n",
      "how it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'--\n",
      "I remember that perfectly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\n",
      "Knightley.  \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.\n",
      "But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!\n",
      "There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his\n",
      "parents and natural home!  I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston\n",
      "could part with him.  To give up one's child!  I really never\n",
      "could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\"\n",
      "observed Mr. John Knightley coolly.  \"But you need not imagine\n",
      "Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry\n",
      "or John.  Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,\n",
      "than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,\n",
      "and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,\n",
      "much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,\n",
      "upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his\n",
      "neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any\n",
      "thing that home affords.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,\n",
      "and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let\n",
      "it pass.  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was\n",
      "something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,\n",
      "the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's\n",
      "disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,\n",
      "and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination\n",
      "of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him\n",
      "in Isabella's first day.  Emma's sense of right however had decided it;\n",
      "and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,\n",
      "she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late\n",
      "disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him\n",
      "the proper invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hoped they might now become friends again.  She thought it\n",
      "was time to make up.  Making-up indeed would not do.  _She_ certainly\n",
      "had not been in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had.\n",
      "Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear\n",
      "to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather\n",
      "assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room\n",
      "she had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl\n",
      "about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,\n",
      "and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms.  It did assist;\n",
      "for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon\n",
      "led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child\n",
      "out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.\n",
      "Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving\n",
      "her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,\n",
      "she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\n",
      "As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\n",
      "but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men\n",
      "and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your\n",
      "dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,\n",
      "we might always think alike.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being\n",
      "in the wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason good.  I was sixteen years\n",
      "old when you were born.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A material difference then,\" she replied--\"and no doubt you were\n",
      "much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does\n",
      "not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings\n",
      "a good deal nearer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--a good deal _nearer_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,\n",
      "if we think differently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by\n",
      "not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.  Come, my dear Emma,\n",
      "let us be friends, and say no more about it.  Tell your aunt, little Emma,\n",
      "that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\n",
      "old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's true,\" she cried--\"very true.  Little Emma, grow up\n",
      "a better woman than your aunt.  Be infinitely cleverer and not\n",
      "half so conceited.  Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I\n",
      "have done.  As far as good intentions went, we were _both_ right,\n",
      "and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet\n",
      "proved wrong.  I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,\n",
      "very bitterly disappointed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\n",
      "Knightley made his appearance, and \"How d'ye do, George?\" and \"John,\n",
      "how are you?\" succeeded in the true English style, burying under\n",
      "a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment\n",
      "which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing\n",
      "for the good of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined\n",
      "cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his\n",
      "dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;\n",
      "on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;\n",
      "their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma\n",
      "only occasionally joining in one or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\n",
      "of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\n",
      "and who was always the greater talker.  As a magistrate, he had\n",
      "generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,\n",
      "some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand\n",
      "the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear\n",
      "next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail\n",
      "of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been\n",
      "the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.\n",
      "The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,\n",
      "and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,\n",
      "was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his\n",
      "cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever\n",
      "left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached\n",
      "a tone of eagerness.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying\n",
      "a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand,\n",
      "and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one\n",
      "of her five children--\"How long it is, how terribly long since you\n",
      "were here!  And how tired you must be after your journey!  You must\n",
      "go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you\n",
      "before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.\n",
      "My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,\n",
      "that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article\n",
      "as herself;--and two basins only were ordered.  After a little\n",
      "more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its\n",
      "not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,\n",
      "with an air of grave reflection,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn\n",
      "at South End instead of coming here.  I never had much opinion\n",
      "of the sea air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we\n",
      "should not have gone.  He recommended it for all the children,\n",
      "but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--\n",
      "both sea air and bathing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her\n",
      "any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,\n",
      "though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very\n",
      "rarely of use to any body.  I am sure it almost killed me once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come,\" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \"I must\n",
      "beg you not to talk of the sea.  It makes me envious and miserable;--\n",
      "I who have never seen it!  South End is prohibited, if you please.\n",
      "My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about\n",
      "Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, pretty well; but not quite well.  Poor Perry is bilious,\n",
      "and he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has\n",
      "not time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is\n",
      "always wanted all round the country.  I suppose there is not a man\n",
      "in such practice anywhere.  But then there is not so clever a man\n",
      "any where.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\n",
      "I have a great regard for Mr. Perry.  I hope he will be calling soon.\n",
      "He will be so pleased to see my little ones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\n",
      "him about myself of some consequence.  And, my dear, whenever he comes,\n",
      "you had better let him look at little Bella's throat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly\n",
      "any uneasiness about it.  Either bathing has been of the greatest\n",
      "service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent\n",
      "embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying\n",
      "at times ever since August.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been\n",
      "of use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,\n",
      "I would have spoken to--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma,\n",
      "\"I have not heard one inquiry after them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you\n",
      "mention them in most of your letters.  I hope they are quite well.\n",
      "Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take\n",
      "my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--\n",
      "And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--\n",
      "How are they, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.  But poor Mrs. Bates\n",
      "had a bad cold about a month ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How sorry I am!  But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\n",
      "this autumn.  Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them\n",
      "more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree\n",
      "you mention.  Perry says that colds have been very general,\n",
      "but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.\n",
      "Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\n",
      "a sickly season.  Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.\n",
      "It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--\n",
      "and the air so bad!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air.  Our part of London is\n",
      "very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\n",
      "in general, my dear sir.  The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square\n",
      "is very different from almost all the rest.  We are so very airy!\n",
      "I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--\n",
      "there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my\n",
      "children in:  but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks\n",
      "the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as\n",
      "to air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.  You make the best of it--\n",
      "but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you\n",
      "different creatures; you do not look like the same.  Now I cannot say,\n",
      "that I think you are any of you looking well at present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\n",
      "little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\n",
      "free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\n",
      "rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were\n",
      "a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness\n",
      "of coming.  I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;\n",
      "for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe\n",
      "he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.  I trust,\n",
      "at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\"\n",
      "turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.  I think Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley very far from looking well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\n",
      "Knightley, hearing his own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you\n",
      "looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.\n",
      "I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen\n",
      "Mr. Wingfield before you left home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Isabella,\"--exclaimed he hastily--\"pray do not concern\n",
      "yourself about my looks.  Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\n",
      "yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\n",

      "from Scotland, to look after his new estate.  What will it answer?\n",
      "Will not the old prejudice be too strong?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\n",
      "to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\n",
      "worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;\n",
      "and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general,\n",
      "she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\n",
      "accidentally in town!  What happiness it must be to her good old\n",
      "grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!\n",
      "I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot\n",
      "be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose\n",
      "Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.\n",
      "She would be such a delightful companion for Emma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another\n",
      "pretty kind of young person.  You will like Harriet.  Emma could\n",

      "\"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be\n",
      "so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of\n",
      "similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening\n",
      "did not close without a little return of agitation.  The gruel came\n",
      "and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--\n",
      "undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,\n",
      "and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was\n",
      "never met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures\n",
      "which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore\n",
      "most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman\n",
      "hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she\n",
      "meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.\n",
      "Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able\n",

      "her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed,\n",
      "\"Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to\n",
      "South End.  It does not bear talking of.\"  And for a little while\n",
      "she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination\n",
      "might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is\n",
      "quite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,\n",
      "never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield\n",
      "says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;\n",
      "and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands\n",
      "the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been\n",

      "quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.\n",
      "You should have consulted Perry.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\n",
      "should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much\n",
      "to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\n",
      "better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,\n",
      "\"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for.\n",
      "Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--\n",
      "at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may\n",
      "be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--\n",
      "I want his directions no more than his drugs.\"  He paused--\n",

      "\"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children\n",
      "a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense\n",

      "\n",
      "\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\n",
      "\"very true.  That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I\n",
      "was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning\n",
      "it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows,\n",
      "I cannot conceive any difficulty.  I should not attempt it,\n",
      "if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,\n",
      "but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . .\n",
      "The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps.\n",
      "I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we\n",

      "Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\n",
      "among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking\n",
      "over what she had done every evening with her father and sister.\n",
      "She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass\n",
      "so swiftly.  It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than\n",
      "their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out\n",
      "of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.\n",
      "Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls\n",
      "one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible\n",
      "thing in preference to a division of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty\n",
      "if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses\n",
      "were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than\n",
      "a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;\n",
      "nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one\n",
      "of the carriages find room for Harriet also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,\n",
      "were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,\n",
      "as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination\n",
      "being consulted in every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event\n",
      "that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been\n",
      "spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed\n",
      "with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed\n",
      "by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.\n",
      "Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed\n",
      "with regard to Randalls.  She was very feverish and had a bad\n",
      "sore throat:  Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry\n",
      "was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist\n",
      "the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,\n",
      "though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\n",
      "Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her\n",
      "at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having\n",
      "a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.\n",
      "She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she\n",
      "was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as\n",
      "they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--\n",
      "of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going\n",
      "to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield--\n",
      "they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the\n",
      "daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,\n",
      "glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed\n",
      "to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they\n",
      "were hastening home for.  They joined company and proceeded together.\n",
      "Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;--\n",
      "\"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,\n",
      "a quick, low pulse, &c.  and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard\n",
      "that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\n",
      "alarmed her with them.\"  Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,\n",
      "as he exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious.  I hope not of a putrid\n",
      "infectious sort.  Has Perry seen her?  Indeed you should take care\n",
      "of yourself as well as of your friend.  Let me entreat you to run\n",
      "no risks.  Why does not Perry see her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\n",
      "excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience\n",
      "and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness\n",
      "which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather\n",
      "feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite\n",
      "another subject,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much\n",
      "like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,\n",
      "I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father\n",
      "from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem\n",
      "to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it\n",
      "would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  But, upon\n",
      "my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.\n",
      "You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider\n",
      "what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,\n",
      "I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home\n",
      "and take care of yourself to-night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\n",
      "which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\n",
      "care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of\n",
      "her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--\n",
      "but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions\n",
      "and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,\n",
      "was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its\n",
      "being \"very cold, certainly very cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in\n",
      "having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power\n",
      "of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do quite right,\" said she;--\"we will make your apologies\n",
      "to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\n",
      "offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's\n",
      "only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much\n",
      "prompt satisfaction.  It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,\n",
      "and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than\n",
      "at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes\n",
      "more exulting than when he next looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I\n",
      "had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave\n",
      "Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,\n",
      "in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--\n",
      "such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in\n",
      "the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,\n",
      "almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must\n",
      "be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young\n",
      "man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,\n",
      "he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.\n",
      "What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,\n",
      "but will not dine alone for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\n",
      "the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment\n",
      "in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his\n",
      "voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared\n",
      "for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be\n",
      "able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself\n",
      "off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\n",
      "began with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\n",
      "Mr. Elton.  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.\n",
      "With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies\n",
      "to please, every feature works.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\n",
      "is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook\n",
      "a great deal.  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,\n",
      "he will have the advantage over negligent superiority.  There is\n",
      "such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot\n",
      "but value.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,\n",
      "\"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining\n",
      "me to be Mr. Elton's object?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\n",
      "occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether\n",
      "it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.\n",
      "I think your manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend,\n",
      "Emma.  You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,\n",
      "and what you mean to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.  Mr. Elton\n",
      "and I are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on,\n",
      "amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often\n",
      "arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes\n",
      "which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;\n",
      "and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind\n",
      "and ignorant, and in want of counsel.  He said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,\n",
      "that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea\n",
      "of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually\n",
      "with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent\n",
      "consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full\n",
      "of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at\n",
      "Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.\n",
      "The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage\n",
      "was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,\n",
      "and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only\n",
      "a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.\n",
      "The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice\n",
      "of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\n",
      "which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\n",
      "nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;\n",
      "and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in\n",
      "expressing his discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when\n",
      "he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such\n",
      "a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.  He must think\n",
      "himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.\n",
      "It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--\n",
      "The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the\n",
      "folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can!\n",
      "If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of\n",
      "duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,\n",
      "probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward\n",
      "voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,\n",
      "which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,\n",
      "to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--\n",
      "here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another\n",
      "man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\n",
      "and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\n",
      "Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses\n",
      "and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,\n",
      "shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they\n",
      "might have had at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt\n",
      "he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \"Very true, my love,\"\n",
      "which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;\n",
      "but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer\n",
      "at all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;\n",
      "her heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to talk,\n",
      "and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\n",
      "her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,\n",
      "and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.\n",
      "Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.  Mr. Elton\n",
      "was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful\n",
      "in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have\n",
      "received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her.\n",
      "She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, \"Much the same--\n",
      "not better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,\" said she presently, \"was not\n",
      "so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was _my_ answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice\n",
      "of sentiment as he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\n",
      "when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing\n",
      "before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\n",
      "by no means better, rather worse.  Very much grieved and concerned--\n",
      "I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial\n",
      "as I knew had been given her in the morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part\n",
      "of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\n",
      "it is a most severe cold indeed.  Mr. Perry has been with her,\n",
      "as you probably heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\n",
      "morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.  But it is\n",
      "impossible not to feel uneasiness.  Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;\n",
      "but it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay when\n",
      "only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\n",
      "and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin\n",
      "for carriages.  How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to\n",
      "feel cold with such precautions.  The contrivances of modern days\n",
      "indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete.\n",
      "One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath\n",
      "of air can find its way unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely\n",
      "of no consequence.  It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage\n",
      "we know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal\n",
      "of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton.  \"Quite seasonable;\n",
      "and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not\n",
      "begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very\n",
      "possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had\n",
      "there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.\n",
      "This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.  At Christmas\n",
      "every body invites their friends about them, and people think little\n",
      "of even the worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend's house once\n",
      "for a week.  Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night,\n",
      "and could not get away till that very day se'nnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,\n",
      "but said only, coolly,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too\n",
      "much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.\n",
      "Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are sure of excellent fires,\" continued he, \"and every thing\n",
      "in the greatest comfort.  Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--\n",
      "Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly\n",
      "what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--\n",
      "it will be a small party, but where small parties are select,\n",
      "they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.  Mr. Weston's dining-room\n",
      "does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,\n",
      "I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than\n",
      "exceed by two.  I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft\n",
      "air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\n",
      "though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties\n",
      "of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine\n",
      "with any body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the\n",
      "law had been so great a slavery.  Well, sir, the time must come\n",
      "when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little\n",
      "labour and great enjoyment.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman\n",
      "as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must\n",
      "compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his\n",
      "ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,\n",
      "to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,\n",
      "and shew herself just as happy as she was.  To her it was real\n",
      "enjoyment to be with the Westons.  Mr. Weston was a great favourite,\n",
      "and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with\n",
      "such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related\n",
      "with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being\n",
      "always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,\n",
      "arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.\n",
      "She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not\n",
      "a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication\n",
      "of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private\n",
      "life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might\n",
      "not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;\n",
      "but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice\n",
      "was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as\n",
      "possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,\n",
      "and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through\n",
      "before her arrival.  Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long\n",
      "enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own\n",
      "and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed\n",
      "just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come\n",
      "and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,\n",
      "was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\n",
      "sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was\n",
      "close to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange\n",
      "insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat\n",
      "at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance\n",
      "on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.\n",
      "Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could\n",
      "not avoid the internal suggestion of \"Can it really be as my brother\n",
      "imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer\n",
      "his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\"--\n",
      "Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be\n",
      "so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston;\n",
      "and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal\n",
      "and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,\n",
      "and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.\n",
      "For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope\n",
      "that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;\n",
      "but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst\n",
      "the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense,\n",
      "which she particularly wished to listen to.  She heard enough\n",
      "to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;\n",
      "she heard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\"\n",
      "repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables\n",
      "very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from\n",
      "his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was\n",
      "so completely past that any reviving question from her would have\n",
      "been awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying,\n",
      "there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,\n",
      "which always interested her.  She had frequently thought--especially since\n",
      "his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she _were_ to marry,\n",
      "he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.\n",
      "He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.\n",
      "She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew\n",
      "them must think of.  That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was\n",
      "very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,\n",
      "or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more\n",
      "replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great\n",
      "curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,\n",
      "of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure\n",
      "in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\n",
      "but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling\n",
      "very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not\n",
      "possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,\n",
      "or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--\n",
      "for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\n",
      "at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares\n",
      "of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,\n",
      "to say to her,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We want only two more to be just the right number.  I should\n",
      "like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,\n",
      "and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.\n",
      "I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room\n",
      "that we are expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning,\n",
      "and he will be with us within a fortnight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented\n",
      "to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making\n",
      "their party quite complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston,\n",
      "\"ever since September:  every letter has been full of it;\n",
      "but he cannot command his own time.  He has those to please\n",
      "who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes\n",
      "to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.  But now\n",
      "I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost\n",
      "as happy as yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another\n",
      "put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do:\n",
      "but she does not know the parties so well as I do.  The case,\n",
      "you see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:  I did not mention\n",
      "a syllable of it in the other room.  There are secrets in all families,\n",
      "you know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay\n",
      "a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon\n",
      "their being put off.  If they are not put off, he cannot stir.\n",
      "But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,\n",
      "of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:\n",
      "and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or\n",
      "three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\n",
      "I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as confident\n",
      "of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am\n",
      "of being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding\n",
      "towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,\n",
      "and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot\n",
      "calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice\n",
      "of doing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\"\n",
      "replied Emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.  If you\n",
      "think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been\n",
      "at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow\n",
      "myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe\n",
      "her to be very fond of him.  I used to think she was not capable\n",
      "of being fond of any body, except herself:  but she has always been\n",
      "kind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,\n",
      "and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit,\n",
      "in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;\n",
      "for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more\n",
      "heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--\n",
      "yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\n",
      "Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very\n",
      "glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting\n",
      "at the time talked of:  \"for I cannot depend upon his coming.\n",
      "I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.  I am very much afraid\n",
      "that it will all end in nothing.  Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been\n",
      "telling you exactly how the matter stands?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour\n",
      "of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain\n",
      "thing in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty\n",
      "of caprice?\"  Then turning to Isabella, who had not been\n",
      "attending before--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,\n",
      "that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,\n",
      "in my opinion, as his father thinks.  It depends entirely upon\n",
      "his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.\n",
      "To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;\n",
      "and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\"\n",
      "replied Isabella:  \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young\n",
      "man without the greatest compassion.  To be constantly living\n",
      "with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.  It is what we\n",
      "happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life\n",
      "of misery.  What a blessing, that she never had any children!\n",
      "Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.  She should then have\n",
      "heard more:  Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\n",
      "which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\n",
      "would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\n",
      "from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\n",
      "imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.\n",
      "But at present there was nothing more to be said.  Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting\n",
      "long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.\n",
      "Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did\n",
      "he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity\n",
      "of saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any\n",
      "means certain.  I am sorry for it.  The introduction must be unpleasant,\n",
      "whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.\n",
      "Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still\n",
      "afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.\n",
      "I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure\n",
      "there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.\n",
      "There is jealousy.  They are jealous even of his regard for his father.\n",
      "In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston\n",
      "were less sanguine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He ought to come,\" said Emma.  \"If he could stay only a couple\n",
      "of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's\n",
      "not having it in his power to do as much as that.  A young _woman_,\n",
      "if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance\n",
      "from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young\n",
      "_man_'s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week\n",
      "with his father, if he likes it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,\n",
      "before one decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "\"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the\n",
      "conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe,\n",
      "I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:\n",
      "_she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she is so fond of the nephew:  he is so very great a favourite.\n",
      "Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\n",
      "that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,\n",
      "to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\n",
      "towards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,\n",
      "to whom she owes nothing at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,\n",
      "to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:  you must\n",
      "let it go its own way.  I have no doubt of his having, at times,\n",
      "considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him\n",
      "to know beforehand _when_ it will be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied,\n",
      "unless he comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\"\n",
      "continued Mrs. Weston, \"and on others, very little:  and among those,\n",
      "on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be\n",
      "this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\n",
      "tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\n",
      "companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness\n",
      "of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.  Mr. Weston was\n",
      "chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;\n",
      "but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.\n",
      "Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.  He joined\n",
      "them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself\n",
      "between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind\n",
      "by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget\n",
      "his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before,\n",
      "and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen\n",
      "with most friendly smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--\n",
      "her fair, lovely, amiable friend.  \"Did she know?--had she\n",
      "heard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?--\n",
      "he felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her\n",
      "complaint alarmed him considerably.\"  And in this style he talked\n",
      "on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,\n",
      "but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat;\n",
      "and Emma was quite in charity with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\n",
      "he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,\n",
      "than on Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection,\n",
      "than that there should be no infection in the complaint.  He began\n",
      "with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting\n",
      "the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_\n",
      "_him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry\n",
      "and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off\n",
      "and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no\n",
      "putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.  She was vexed.\n",
      "It did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence\n",
      "of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy,\n",
      "if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty\n",
      "in behaving with temper.  He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore\n",
      "her assistance, \"Would not she give him her support?--would not she\n",
      "add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\n",
      "to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder\n",
      "had no infection?  He could not be satisfied without a promise--\n",
      "would not she give him her influence in procuring it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless\n",
      "for herself!  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day,\n",
      "and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated\n",
      "sore throat herself.  Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us.\n",

      "and aid.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great,\n",
      "at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself\n",
      "the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was\n",
      "too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly\n",
      "saying any thing to the purpose.  She could only give him a look;\n",
      "but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses,\n",
      "and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving\n",
      "her all her attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly\n",
      "did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came\n",
      "into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them\n",
      "all with the information of the ground being covered with snow,\n",
      "and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;\n",
      "concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\n",
      "sir.  Something new for your coachman and horses to be making\n",
      "their way through a storm of snow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\n",
      "had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\n",
      "and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.  Mrs. Weston\n",
      "and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention\n",
      "from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I admired your resolution very much, sir,\" said he, \"in venturing\n",
      "out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow\n",
      "very soon.  Every body must have seen the snow coming on.\n",
      "I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.\n",
      "Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable;\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\n",
      "had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,\n",
      "lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse\n",
      "for his hurrying away.  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen\n",
      "or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;\n",
      "he was afraid they would find no difficulty.  He wished the road might\n",
      "be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls;\n",
      "and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might\n",
      "be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him,\n",
      "that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,\n",
      "which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there\n",
      "being but two spare rooms in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\"\n",
      "was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say\n",
      "for some time.  To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances\n",
      "of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses,\n",
      "and of James, and of their having so many friends about them,\n",
      "revived him a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.  The horror of\n",
      "being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,\n",
      "was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just\n",
      "passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,\n",
      "she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain\n",
      "at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through\n",
      "all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she;\n",
      "\"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;\n",
      "and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.\n",
      "I am not at all afraid.  I should not mind walking half the way.\n",
      "I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not\n",
      "the sort of thing that gives me cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" replied he.  \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\n",
      "extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every\n",
      "thing does give you cold.  Walk home!--you are prettily shod\n",
      "for walking home, I dare say.  It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston could only approve.  Isabella then went to Emma;\n",
      "but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being\n",
      "all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point,\n",
      "when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his\n",
      "brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them\n",
      "that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there\n",
      "not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they\n",
      "liked it, either now or an hour hence.  He had gone beyond the sweep--\n",
      "some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half\n",
      "an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground;\n",
      "a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting,\n",
      "and there was every appearance of its being soon over.  He had seen\n",
      "the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing\n",
      "to apprehend.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they\n",
      "were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account,\n",
      "who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\n",
      "constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not\n",
      "be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued\n",
      "at Randalls.  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\n",
      "returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\n",
      "to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:  thus--\n",

      "\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\n",

      "\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.  A few\n",
      "minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion\n",
      "deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other\n",
      "recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carriage came:  and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on\n",
      "such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley\n",
      "and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some\n",
      "renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,\n",
      "and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.\n",
      "\"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.  He was afraid\n",
      "poor Isabella would not like it.  And there would be poor Emma\n",
      "in the carriage behind.  He did not know what they had best do.\n",
      "They must keep as much together as they could;\" and James was talked to,\n",
      "and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\n",
      "did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\n",
      "so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\n",
      "carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\n",
      "and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.  It would not have been\n",
      "the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\n",
      "previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked\n",
      "to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have\n",
      "seemed but one.  But now, she would rather it had not happened.\n",
      "She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine,\n",
      "and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\n",
      "immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity\n",
      "of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\n",
      "they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\n",
      "found her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded,\n",
      "and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:  availing himself\n",
      "of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already\n",
      "well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him;\n",
      "but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled\n",
      "love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect,\n",
      "and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon\n",
      "as possible.  It really was so.  Without scruple--without apology--\n",
      "without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,\n",
      "was professing himself _her_ lover.  She tried to stop him; but vainly;\n",
      "he would go on, and say it all.  Angry as she was, the thought of\n",
      "the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.\n",
      "She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore\n",
      "could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.\n",
      "Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she\n",
      "hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.  This to _me_! you forget yourself--\n",
      "you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\n",
      "be happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!\"--\n",
      "And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\n",
      "pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\n",
      "for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\n",
      "either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.  Command yourself\n",
      "enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,\n",
      "not at all to confuse his intellects.  He perfectly knew his own meaning;\n",
      "and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,\n",
      "and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--\n",
      "but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned\n",
      "at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very\n",
      "urgent for a favourable answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy\n",
      "and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.  You have made\n",
      "yourself too clear.  Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond\n",
      "any thing I can express.  After such behaviour, as I have witnessed\n",
      "during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I\n",
      "have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me\n",
      "in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed,\n",
      "which I had not supposed possible!  Believe me, sir, I am far,\n",
      "very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?--\n",
      "Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course\n",
      "of my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:\n",
      "never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.\n",
      "If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her,\n",
      "and I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "is near!  No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.\n",
      "I have thought only of you.  I protest against having paid the smallest\n",
      "attention to any one else.  Every thing that I have said or done,\n",
      "for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my\n",
      "adoration of yourself.  You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.\n",
      "No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen\n",
      "and understood me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--\n",
      "which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.  She was\n",
      "too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:\n",
      "and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's\n",
      "sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he\n",
      "joyously exclaimed--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.\n",
      "It confesses that you have long understood me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing.  So far from\n",
      "having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error\n",
      "with respect to your views, till this moment.  As to myself, I am\n",
      "very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--\n",
      "Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my\n",
      "friend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me\n",
      "great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:\n",
      "but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,\n",
      "I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits\n",
      "so frequent.  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend\n",
      "yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought\n",
      "seriously of her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn:  \"never, I assure you.\n",
      "_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort\n",
      "of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.\n",
      "I wish her extremely well:  and, no doubt, there are men who might not\n",
      "object to--Every body has their level:  but as for myself, I am not,\n",
      "I think, quite so much at a loss.  I need not so totally despair\n",
      "of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--\n",
      "No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only;\n",
      "and the encouragement I received--\"\n",

      "\"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\n",
      "mistaken in supposing it.  I have seen you only as the admirer\n",
      "of my friend.  In no other light could you have been more to me than\n",
      "a common acquaintance.  I am exceedingly sorry:  but it is well that\n",
      "the mistake ends where it does.  Had the same behaviour continued,\n",
      "Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views;\n",
      "not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very\n",
      "great inequality which you are so sensible of.  But, as it is,\n",
      "the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.\n",
      "I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.\"\n",

      "He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided\n",
      "to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,\n",
      "and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few\n",
      "minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them\n",
      "to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have\n",
      "been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left\n",
      "no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.  Without knowing\n",
      "when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,\n",
      "they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;\n",
      "and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it\n",
      "indispensable to wish him a good night.  The compliment was just returned,\n",
      "coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,\n",
      "she was then conveyed to Hartfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,\n",
      "who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from\n",
      "Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--\n",
      "and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it\n",
      "seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:\n",
      "for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all\n",
      "kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort\n",
      "of her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin\n",
      "of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;\n",
      "and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\n",
      "except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;\n",
      "and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\n",

      "of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\n",
      "thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\n",
      "of all.  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort\n",

      "up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.\n",

      "The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--\n",

      "the charade, with its \"ready wit\"--but then the \"soft eyes\"--\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners\n",
      "to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,\n",
      "as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof\n",
      "among others that he had not always lived in the best society,\n",
      "that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance\n",
      "was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,\n",
      "for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect\n",
      "to her as Harriet's friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on\n",

      "was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she\n",

      "There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.\n",
      "Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\n",

      "less allied with real love.  She need not trouble herself to pity him.\n",
      "He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\n",

      "to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion\n",
      "or mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the\n",
      "gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,\n",

      "Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he\n",

      "The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;\n",
      "but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly\n",

      "of a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.\n",
      "The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,\n",
      "being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all\n",
      "the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources,\n",
      "was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself,\n",

      "Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own\n",

      "The first error and the worst lay at her door.  It was foolish,\n",

      "making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought\n",

      "to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;\n",
      "where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,\n",
      "he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted\n",

      "the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.\n",
      "She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo\n",
      "the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--\n",

      "the will of others.  It ought to have been a habit with him by\n",
      "this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.\n",
      "I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.\n",
      "As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off\n",
      "all that was unworthy in their authority.  He ought to have opposed\n",
      "the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.\n",
      "Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is\n",
      "nothing extraordinary.  I have not the least idea of his being\n",
      "a weak young man:  I feel sure that he is not.  Mr. Weston would\n",
      "not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely\n",
      "to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit\n",
      "your notions of man's perfection.  I dare say he has; and though\n",
      "it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,\n",
      "and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself\n",
      "extremely expert in finding excuses for it.  He can sit down and\n",
      "write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods,\n",
      "and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method\n",
      "in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's\n",
      "having any right to complain.  His letters disgust me.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston.  They hardly can\n",
      "satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings:  standing in\n",
      "a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her.\n",
      "It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,\n",
      "and she must doubly feel the omission.  Had she been a person\n",
      "of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would\n",
      "not have signified whether he did or no.  Can you think your friend\n",
      "behindhand in these sort of considerations?  Do you suppose she\n",
      "does not often say all this to herself?  No, Emma, your amiable\n",
      "young man can be amiable only in French, not in English.  He may be\n",
      "very `aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!--not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do\n",
      "not want to think ill of him.  I should be as ready to acknowledge\n",
      "his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are\n",
      "merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\n",
      "plausible manners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a\n",
      "treasure at Highbury.  We do not often look upon fine young men,\n",
      "well-bred and agreeable.  We must not be nice and ask for all\n",
      "the virtues into the bargain.  Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "what a _sensation_ his coming will produce?  There will be but one subject\n",
      "throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--\n",
      "one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;\n",
      "we shall think and speak of nobody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste\n",
      "of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being\n",
      "universally agreeable.  To you, he will talk of farming; to me,\n",
      "of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general\n",
      "information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,\n",
      "or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak\n",
      "extremely well on each; that is my idea of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\n",
      "thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!\n",
      "What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--\n",
      "the practised politician, who is to read every body's character,\n",
      "and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his\n",
      "own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he\n",
      "may make all appear like fools compared with himself!  My dear Emma,\n",

      "to the point.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be\n",
      "of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real\n",
      "liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;\n",
      "for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid\n",

      "Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,\n",
      "in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.\n",
      "She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;\n",
      "and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject\n",
      "as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she\n",
      "had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must\n",
      "suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!\" she found something else must be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\n",
      "She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.\n",
      "There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and\n",
      "Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered\n",
      "by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her,\n",
      "as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she\n",
      "ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\n",
      "as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\n",
      "of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--\n",
      "and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate\n",
      "and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,\n",
      "and therefore she seldom went near them.  But now she made the sudden\n",
      "resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,\n",
      "as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,\n",
      "they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house belonged to people in business.  Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\n",
      "the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\n",
      "which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially\n",
      "and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her\n",
      "knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up\n",
      "her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter,\n",
      "almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for\n",
      "their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's,\n",
      "and sweet-cake from the beaufet--\"Mrs. Cole had just been there,\n",
      "just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an\n",
      "hour with them, and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind\n",
      "as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\n",
      "There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from\n",
      "Mr. Elton since his going away.  Emma knew what was coming; they must\n",
      "have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone,\n",
      "and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he\n",
      "was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies'\n",
      "ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the\n",
      "interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always\n",
      "putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "This she had been prepared for when she entered the house;\n",
      "but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther\n",
      "incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst\n",
      "all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.\n",
      "She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;\n",
      "but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away\n",
      "from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from\n",
      "her niece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--\n",
      "Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--\n",
      "Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;\n",
      "for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her,\n",
      "Jane is so very great a favourite there.  Whenever she is with us,\n",
      "Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough;\n",
      "and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.\n",
      "And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you\n",
      "cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\n",
      "for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have,\n",
      "we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw\n",
      "any body more surprized.  `Have you, upon your honour?' said she;\n",
      "`well, that is quite unexpected.  Do let me hear what she says.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?  I am extremely happy.\n",
      "I hope she is well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  You are so kind!\" replied the happily deceived aunt,\n",
      "while eagerly hunting for the letter.--\"Oh! here it is.  I was sure\n",
      "it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,\n",
      "without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand\n",
      "so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.\n",
      "I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was\n",
      "reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--\n",
      "a letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;\n",
      "so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under\n",
      "my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what\n",
      "she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,\n",
      "apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see--\n",
      "hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.\n",
      "My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\n",
      "She often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty,\n",
      "now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--\n",
      "don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive\n",
      "to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--\n",
      "every word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had\n",
      "made out every word.  And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not\n",
      "so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!\n",
      "with the help of spectacles.  It is such a blessing!  My mother's\n",
      "are really very good indeed.  Jane often says, when she is here,\n",
      "`I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see\n",
      "as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish\n",
      "my eyes may last me as well.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\n",
      "and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax's handwriting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are extremely kind,\" replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;\n",
      "\"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.\n",
      "I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure\n",
      "as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf\n",
      "you know.  Ma'am,\" addressing her, \"do you hear what Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment\n",
      "repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.\n",
      "She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming\n",
      "very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had\n",
      "almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,\n",
      "when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.\n",
      "By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\n",
      "she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.  But it is very\n",
      "remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\n",
      "Jane speaks so distinct!  However, she will not find her grandmama\n",
      "at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great\n",
      "deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years,\n",
      "you know, since she was here.  We never were so long without seeing\n",
      "her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know\n",
      "how to make enough of her now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes; next week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  You are very kind.  Yes, next week.  Every body is\n",
      "so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.  I am\n",
      "sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they\n",
      "can be to see her.  Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,\n",
      "because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one\n",
      "of those days.  So very good of them to send her the whole way!\n",
      "But they always do, you know.  Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.\n",
      "That is what she writes about.  That is the reason of her writing out\n",
      "of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have\n",
      "heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, so I imagined.  I was afraid there could be little chance\n",
      "of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So obliging of you!  No, we should not have heard, if it had not\n",
      "been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here\n",
      "so soon.  My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months\n",
      "with us at least.  Three months, she says so, positively, as I\n",
      "am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.  The case is,\n",
      "you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.  Mrs. Dixon has\n",
      "persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.\n",
      "They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so\n",
      "impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,\n",
      "she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make\n",
      "it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\n",
      "but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\n",
      "to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was,\n",
      "but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's\n",
      "name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\n",
      "and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back\n",
      "to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.\n",
      "Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--\n",
      "I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;\n",
      "but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak\n",
      "of his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used\n",
      "to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell\n",
      "were very particular about their daughter's not walking out\n",
      "often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them;\n",
      "of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell\n",
      "about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\n",
      "that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he\n",
      "had taken himself.  He is a most amiable, charming young man,\n",
      "I believe.  Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account\n",

      "of farther discovery,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Very true, very true, indeed.  The very thing that we have always\n",

      "at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come\n",
      "if any thing was to happen.  But you see, every thing turns out\n",
      "for the best.  They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to\n",
      "come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;\n",
      "nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation,\n",
      "Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the\n",
      "least backward in any attention.  He is a most charming young man.\n",
      "Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were\n",
      "out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling\n",
      "round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed\n",
      "into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,\n",
      "with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\n",
      "(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we\n",
      "had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish\n",

      "\"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no.  You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\n",

      "She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.\n",
      "Just like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well,\n",
      "that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,\n",
      "and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt\n",
      "that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's\n",
      "youngest daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry,\n",
      "and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,\n",
      "hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\n",
      "remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking\n",
      "under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "By birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old,\n",
      "on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge,\n",
      "the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\n",
      "seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;\n",
      "of her being taught only what very limited means could command,\n",
      "and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,\n",
      "to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,\n",
      "good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave\n",
      "a change to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had\n",
      "very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most\n",
      "deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for\n",
      "such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved\n",
      "his life.  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,\n",
      "though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,\n",
      "before his own return to England put any thing in his power.\n",
      "When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.\n",
      "He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,\n",
      "about Jane's age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits\n",
      "and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,\n",
      "his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being\n",
      "a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell\n",
      "of undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It was accepted;\n",
      "and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family,\n",
      "and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother\n",
      "from time to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;\n",
      "the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father\n",
      "making independence impossible.  To provide for her otherwise\n",
      "was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay\n",
      "and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must\n",
      "be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped\n",
      "to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was Jane Fairfax's history.  She had fallen into good hands,\n",
      "known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given\n",
      "an excellent education.  Living constantly with right-minded\n",
      "and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received\n",
      "every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's\n",
      "residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done\n",
      "full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.\n",
      "Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that\n",
      "friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far\n",
      "as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\n",
      "fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she\n",
      "was too much beloved to be parted with.  Neither father nor mother\n",
      "could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.  The evil day\n",
      "was put off.  It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\n",
      "and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all\n",
      "the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious\n",
      "mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future,\n",
      "the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind\n",
      "her that all this might soon be over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\n",
      "Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party\n",
      "from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty\n",
      "and acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not\n",
      "be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind\n",
      "be unfelt by the parents.  They continued together with unabated\n",
      "regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,\n",
      "that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,\n",
      "giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,\n",
      "engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,\n",
      "almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly\n",
      "and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\n",
      "yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\n",
      "of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment\n",
      "had fixed on for beginning.  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\n",
      "should be the period.  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate,\n",
      "she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,\n",
      "and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,\n",
      "equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\n",
      "a resolution, though their feelings did.  As long as they lived,\n",
      "no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;\n",
      "and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;\n",
      "but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better\n",
      "be soon.  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder\n",
      "and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared\n",
      "her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must\n",
      "now be relinquished.  Still, however, affection was glad to catch\n",
      "at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.\n",
      "She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage;\n",
      "and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,\n",
      "they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being\n",
      "compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,\n",
      "under the most favourable circumstances, to require something\n",
      "more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\n",
      "tolerable comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account\n",
      "to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some\n",
      "truths not told.  It was her own choice to give the time of their\n",
      "absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect\n",
      "liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:\n",
      "and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,\n",
      "whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement\n",
      "their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few\n",
      "months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,\n",
      "than on any thing else.  Certain it was that she was to come;\n",
      "and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\n",
      "had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for\n",
      "the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness\n",
      "of a two years' absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did\n",
      "not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than\n",
      "she wished, and less than she ought!  Why she did not like Jane\n",
      "Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley\n",
      "had once told her it was because she saw in her the really\n",
      "accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;\n",
      "and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,\n",
      "there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could\n",
      "not quite acquit her.  But \"she could never get acquainted with her:\n",
      "she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--\n",
      "such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,\n",
      "her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss\n",
      "with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were\n",
      "to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had\n",
      "supposed they must be so fond of each other.\"  These were her reasons--\n",
      "she had no better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\n",
      "by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\n",
      "considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;\n",
      "and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\n",
      "interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance\n",
      "and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\n",
      "Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had\n",
      "herself the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty,\n",
      "just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could\n",
      "think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most\n",
      "becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance\n",
      "of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.\n",
      "Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--\n",
      "there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;\n",
      "it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes,\n",
      "a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied\n",
      "their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,\n",
      "as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\n",
      "no fuller bloom.  It was a style of beauty, of which elegance\n",
      "was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,\n",
      "by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person\n",
      "or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There, not to be vulgar,\n",
      "was distinction, and merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax\n",
      "with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense\n",
      "of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike\n",
      "her no longer.  When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,\n",
      "as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance\n",
      "was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going\n",
      "to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion\n",
      "and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling\n",
      "her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance\n",
      "of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started\n",
      "to herself.  In that case, nothing could be more pitiable\n",
      "or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\n",
      "Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\n",
      "Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous\n",
      "which her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love,\n",
      "it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.\n",
      "She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,\n",
      "while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,\n",
      "the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit\n",
      "to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from\n",
      "him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\n",
      "as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\n",
      "afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;\n",
      "nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were charming feelings--but not lasting.  Before she had\n",
      "committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\n",
      "Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices\n",
      "and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome;\n",
      "she is better than handsome!\"  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield\n",
      "with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much\n",
      "into its usual state.  Former provocations reappeared.  The aunt\n",
      "was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her\n",
      "health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to\n",
      "listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\n",
      "she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,\n",
      "as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her\n",
      "mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.  They had music;\n",
      "Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily\n",
      "followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air\n",
      "of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\n",
      "superior performance.  She was, besides, which was the worst of all,\n",
      "so cold, so cautious!  There was no getting at her real opinion.\n",
      "Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined\n",
      "to hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more\n",
      "reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.\n",
      "She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character,\n",
      "or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness\n",
      "of the match.  It was all general approbation and smoothness;\n",
      "nothing delineated or distinguished.  It did her no service however.\n",
      "Her caution was thrown away.  Emma saw its artifice, and returned\n",
      "to her first surmises.  There probably _was_ something more to conceal\n",
      "than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near\n",
      "changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell,\n",
      "for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The like reserve prevailed on other topics.  She and Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "had been at Weymouth at the same time.  It was known that they were\n",
      "a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\n",
      "procure as to what he truly was.  \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She believed\n",
      "he was reckoned a very fine young man.\"  \"Was he agreeable?\"--\n",
      "\"He was generally thought so.\"  \"Did he appear a sensible young man;\n",
      "a young man of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common\n",
      "London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.\n",
      "Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer\n",
      "knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.  She believed\n",
      "every body found his manners pleasing.\"  Emma could not forgive her.\n",

      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\n",
      "were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\n",
      "seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,\n",
      "he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on\n",
      "business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so\n",
      "openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,\n",
      "but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.\n",
      "He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great\n",
      "pleasure in marking an improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,\n",
      "and the papers swept away;--\"particularly pleasant.  You and Miss\n",
      "Fairfax gave us some very good music.  I do not know a more\n",
      "luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained\n",
      "a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music\n",
      "and sometimes with conversation.  I am sure Miss Fairfax must\n",
      "have found the evening pleasant, Emma.  You left nothing undone.\n",
      "I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\n",
      "at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am happy you approved,\" said Emma, smiling; \"but I hope I am\n",
      "not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you\n",
      "are not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.\n",
      "If any thing, you are too attentive.  The muffin last night--if it\n",
      "had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \"you are not\n",
      "often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.\n",
      "I think you understand me, therefore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough;\" but she\n",
      "said only, \"Miss Fairfax is reserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome\n",
      "all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that\n",
      "has its foundation in diffidence.  What arises from discretion\n",
      "must be honoured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think her diffident.  I do not see it.\"\n",

      "had not a pleasant evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\n",
      "and amused to think how little information I obtained.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am disappointed,\" was his only answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope every body had a pleasant evening,\" said Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "in his quiet way.  \"I had.  Once, I felt the fire rather too much;\n",
      "but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did\n",
      "not disturb me.  Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,\n",
      "as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.  However,\n",
      "she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.\n",
      "I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of\n",
      "young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.\n",
      "She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she\n",

      "whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!\n",
      "a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one\n",
      "can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--\n",
      "Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them\n",
      "a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is\n",
      "not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma,\n",
      "unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried,\n",
      "as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,\n",
      "for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--\n",
      "do not you think so, my dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\n",
      "There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\n",
      "and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right, my dear, very right.  I had not thought of it before,\n",
      "but that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,\n",
      "if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,\n",
      "just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a\n",
      "boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider\n",
      "it unwholesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley presently, \"I have a piece of news for you.\n",
      "You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think\n",
      "will interest you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"News!  Oh! yes, I always like news.  What is it?--why do you\n",
      "smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had time only to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\" when the door\n",
      "was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.\n",
      "Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to\n",
      "give quickest.  Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,\n",
      "and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?  My dear Miss Woodhouse--\n",
      "I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!\n",
      "You are too bountiful!  Have you heard the news?  Mr. Elton is going\n",
      "to be married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was\n",
      "so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,\n",
      "and a little blush, at the sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction\n",
      "of some part of what had passed between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where could _you_ hear it?\" cried Miss Bates.  \"Where could\n",
      "you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?  For it is not five minutes\n",
      "since I received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--\n",
      "or at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready\n",
      "to come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about\n",
      "the pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--\n",
      "for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan\n",
      "large enough.  So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said,\n",
      "`Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold,\n",
      "and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh! my dear,'\n",
      "said I--well, and just then came the note.  A Miss Hawkins--\n",
      "that's all I know.  A Miss Hawkins of Bath.  But, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole\n",
      "told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.  A Miss Hawkins--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.\n",
      "He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it\n",
      "to me directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\n",
      "generally interesting.  My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.\n",
      "My mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a\n",
      "thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We consider our Hartfield pork,\" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it\n",
      "certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\n",
      "cannot have a greater pleasure than--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\n",
      "to us.  If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\n",
      "themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\n",
      "We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'\n",
      "Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.\"--\n",
      "Here was a sly glance at Emma.  \"He had been so fortunate as to--\n",
      "I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.\n",
      "The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married\n",
      "to a Miss Hawkins.  By his style, I should imagine it just settled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton going to be married!\" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\n",
      "\"He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is very young to settle,\" was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.\n",
      "\"He had better not be in a hurry.  He seemed to me very well off\n",
      "as he was.  We were always glad to see him at Hartfield.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\" said Miss Bates,\n",
      "joyfully; \"my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot\n",
      "bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.\n",
      "This is great news, indeed.  Jane, you have never seen\n",
      "Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly\n",
      "to occupy her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\" she replied, starting on this appeal;\n",
      "\"is he--is he a tall man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who shall answer that question?\" cried Emma.  \"My father would\n",
      "say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is\n",
      "just the happy medium.  When you have been here a little longer,\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard\n",
      "of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.  He is the very best\n",
      "young man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday\n",
      "he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.  Miss Hawkins,--I dare say,\n",
      "an excellent young woman.  His extreme attention to my mother--\n",
      "wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better,\n",
      "for my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she\n",
      "does not hear quite quick.  Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a\n",
      "little deaf.  He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--\n",
      "but she says it did him no lasting benefit.  Colonel Campbell,\n",
      "you know, is quite our angel.  And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming\n",
      "young man, quite worthy of him.  It is such a happiness when good\n",
      "people get together--and they always do.  Now, here will be Mr. Elton\n",
      "and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;\n",
      "and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple\n",
      "than Mr. and Mrs. Perry.  I say, sir,\" turning to Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "\"I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.\n",
      "I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir,\n",
      "if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--\n",
      "a roast loin of pork--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been\n",
      "acquainted with her,\" said Emma, \"nothing I suppose can be known.\n",
      "One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.  He has been\n",
      "gone only four weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\n",
      "Emma said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take\n",
      "an interest in this news.  You, who have been hearing and seeing\n",
      "so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep\n",
      "in the business on Miss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse\n",
      "your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I have seen Mr. Elton,\" replied Jane, \"I dare say I\n",
      "shall be interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me.\n",
      "And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression\n",
      "may be a little worn off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,\"\n",
      "said Miss Bates, \"four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\n",
      "always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts;\n",
      "not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said,\n",
      "`No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do\n",
      "not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries.\n",
      "I do not pretend to it.  What is before me, I see.  At the same time,\n",
      "nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\n",
      "offend for the world.  How does Miss Smith do?  She seems quite\n",
      "recovered now.  Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?\n",
      "Oh! those dear little children.  Jane, do you know I always fancy\n",
      "Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.  I mean in person--tall, and with\n",
      "that sort of look--and not very talkative.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\n",
      "One takes up a notion, and runs away with it.  Mr. Dixon, you say,\n",
      "is not, strictly speaking, handsome?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Handsome!  Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.  I told you he\n",
      "was plain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\n",
      "and that you yourself--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.  Where I have a regard,\n",
      "I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed\n",
      "the general opinion, when I called him plain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.\n",
      "The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.\n",
      "You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must\n",
      "take leave.  This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed.\n",
      "I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes:\n",
      "and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you\n",
      "out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already.\n",
      "Thank you, we do indeed.  I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,\n",
      "for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork:\n",
      "when we dress the leg it will be another thing.  Good morning to you,\n",
      "my dear sir.  Oh!  Mr. Knightley is coming too.  Well, that is\n",
      "so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to\n",
      "give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning\n",
      "to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him\n",
      "while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--\n",
      "and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give\n",
      "to her own view of the subject.  It was to herself an amusing\n",
      "and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton\n",
      "could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet:\n",
      "Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving\n",
      "the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly\n",
      "from others.  It was now about the time that she was likely to call.\n",
      "If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning\n",
      "to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\n",
      "detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would\n",
      "undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\n",
      "when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\n",
      "hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the\n",
      "\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\" which instantly\n",
      "burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.\n",
      "As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater\n",
      "kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly\n",
      "through what she had to tell.  \"She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been\n",
      "afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might\n",
      "get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;\n",
      "but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman\n",
      "was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step\n",
      "in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\n",
      "half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\n",
      "and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast\n",
      "as she could, and took shelter at Ford's.\"--Ford's was the principal\n",
      "woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united;\n",
      "the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so,\n",
      "there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,\n",
      "full ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--\n",
      "to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--\n",
      "who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--\n",
      "Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think.  I thought I should have fainted.\n",
      "I did not know what to do.  I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth saw\n",
      "me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.\n",
      "I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\n",
      "no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;\n",
      "and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\n",
      "I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.  I could not go away\n",
      "you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere\n",
      "in the world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last,\n",
      "I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going\n",
      "on with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.\n",
      "I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking\n",
      "that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came quite up\n",
      "to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\n",
      "if I would.  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used;\n",
      "I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be\n",
      "very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time;\n",
      "but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember\n",
      "she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost\n",
      "too kind!  Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!\n",
      "By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined\n",
      "that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--\n",
      "I found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as\n",
      "if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,\n",
      "and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,\n",
      "you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it\n",
      "did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\n",
      "three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,\n",
      "if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round\n",
      "by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated\n",
      "by this rain.  Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me!\n",
      "So I said, I was very much obliged to him:  you know I could\n",
      "not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round\n",
      "by the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,\n",
      "or any thing about it.  Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done\n",
      "any thing than have it happen:  and yet, you know, there was a sort\n",
      "of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.\n",

      "me comfortable again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\n",
      "her power.  She was obliged to stop and think.  She was not thoroughly\n",
      "comfortable herself.  The young man's conduct, and his sister's,\n",
      "seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.\n",
      "As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture\n",
      "of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.\n",
      "But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before;\n",
      "and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?\n",
      "It was folly to be disturbed by it.  Of course, he must be sorry\n",

      "as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.\n",
      "He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing\n",
      "for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\n",
      "of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\n",
      "of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of\n",
      "some dignity, as well as some convenience:  the story told well;\n",
      "he had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l.\n",
      "or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--\n",
      "the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\n",
      "distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole\n",
      "of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps\n",
      "so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's,\n",
      "and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--\n",
      "with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady\n",
      "had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,\n",
      "to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,\n",
      "that vanity and prudence were equally contented.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,\n",
      "and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself\n",
      "and his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be\n",
      "laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing\n",
      "all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,\n",
      "he would have been more cautiously gallant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves\n",
      "to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for;\n",
      "and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation,\n",
      "which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict,\n",
      "that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\n",
      "enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her\n",
      "the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique\n",
      "and pretension, now spread over his air.  She was, in fact,\n",
      "beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing\n",
      "at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very\n",
      "disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance,\n",
      "a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind,\n",
      "she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.\n",
      "She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare\n",
      "twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly\n",
      "be lessened by his marriage.  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--\n",
      "many awkwardnesses smoothed by it.  A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be an excuse for\n",
      "any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.\n",
      "It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.  She was good\n",
      "enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--\n",
      "handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side.\n",
      "As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,\n",
      "that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,\n",
      "he had done nothing.  On that article, truth seemed attainable.\n",
      "_What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out;\n",
      "and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at\n",
      "all Harriet's superior.  She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.\n",
      "Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--\n",
      "merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the\n",
      "profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was\n",
      "not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\n",
      "moderate also.  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\n",
      "but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though\n",
      "the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--\n",
      "in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded\n",
      "of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter\n",
      "had lived.  Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,\n",
      "and too stupid to rise.  And all the grandeur of the connexion\n",
      "seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_,\n",
      "to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!\n",
      "That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of\n",
      "Miss Hawkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!\n",
      "She had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be\n",
      "talked out of it.  The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies\n",
      "of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away.  He might be superseded\n",
      "by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer;\n",
      "even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,\n",
      "she feared, would cure her.  Harriet was one of those, who,\n",
      "having once begun, would be always in love.  And now, poor girl!\n",
      "she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.\n",
      "She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.  Emma saw\n",
      "him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure\n",
      "_just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him, _just_ to hear his voice,\n",
      "or see his shoulder, _just_ to have something occur to preserve him\n",
      "in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.\n",
      "She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when\n",
      "at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,\n",
      "and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;\n",
      "and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already\n",
      "occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,\n",
      "comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually\n",
      "in agitation around her.  Her regard was receiving strength by\n",
      "invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings\n",
      "irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness,\n",
      "and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--\n",
      "his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat,\n",
      "being all in proof of how much he was in love!\n",
      "\n",
      "Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain\n",
      "to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of\n",
      "Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.\n",
      "Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each\n",
      "was occasionally useful as a check to the other.  Mr. Elton's\n",
      "engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin.\n",
      "The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been\n",
      "a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's\n",
      "a few days afterwards.  Harriet had not been at home; but a note had\n",
      "been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;\n",
      "a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness;\n",
      "and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied\n",
      "by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\n",
      "and wishing to do more than she dared to confess.  But Mr. Elton,\n",
      "in person, had driven away all such cares.  While he staid,\n",
      "the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off\n",
      "for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\n",
      "judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--\n",
      "and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful\n",
      "consideration.  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,\n",
      "when invited to come, would be ingratitude.  It must not be:\n",
      "and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!--\n",
      "\n",
      "After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's\n",
      "returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,\n",
      "should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.\n",
      "She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill,\n",
      "while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon,\n",
      "as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\n",
      "recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what\n",
      "degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could think of nothing better:  and though there was something\n",
      "in it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,\n",
      "merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Small heart had Harriet for visiting.  Only half an hour before her\n",
      "friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led\n",
      "her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to\n",
      "_The_ _Rev._ _Philip_ _Elton_, _White-Hart_, _Bath_, was to be seen under the\n",
      "operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to\n",
      "convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,\n",
      "excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to\n",
      "be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led\n",
      "between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every\n",
      "thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,\n",
      "was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,\n",
      "Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity,\n",
      "which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed\n",
      "quarter of an hour.  She went on herself, to give that portion\n",
      "of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\n",
      "and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay,\n",
      "and unattended by any alarming young man.  She came solitarily\n",
      "down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,\n",
      "and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.\n",
      "She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her\n",
      "enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it\n",
      "was creating.  She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.\n",
      "They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing\n",
      "beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--\n",
      "till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden,\n",
      "that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more\n",
      "interesting subject, and a warmer manner.  In that very room\n",
      "she had been measured last September, with her two friends.\n",
      "There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by\n",
      "the window.  _He_ had done it.  They all seemed to remember the day,\n",
      "the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,\n",
      "the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;\n",
      "and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma\n",
      "must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)\n",
      "when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.  The style of\n",
      "the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.\n",
      "Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully\n",
      "passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture\n",
      "it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally\n",
      "Harriet must suffer.  It was a bad business.  She would have given\n",
      "a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins\n",
      "in a higher rank of life.  They were so deserving, that a _little_\n",
      "higher should have been enough:  but as it was, how could she have\n",
      "done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.  They must\n",
      "be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--\n",
      "so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity\n",
      "of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls\n",
      "to procure it.  Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.\n",
      "The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard\n",
      "that neither \"master nor mistress was at home;\" they had both\n",
      "been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away.  \"And now we\n",
      "shall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been\n",
      "so disappointed.\"  And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge\n",
      "her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--\n",
      "such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.\n",
      "Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt\n",
      "by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.\n",
      "There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater\n",
      "pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted\n",
      "her with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--\n",
      "glad to see him so well.  Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter\n",
      "this morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--\n",
      "he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would\n",
      "be so.  If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days;\n",
      "I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going\n",
      "to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.\n",
      "We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly\n",
      "as we could wish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\n",
      "influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all\n",
      "was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,\n",
      "but not less to the purpose.  To know that _she_ thought his coming\n",
      "certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did\n",
      "she rejoice in their joy.  It was a most delightful reanimation\n",
      "of exhausted spirits.  The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness\n",
      "of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought,\n",
      "she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,\n",
      "which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at\n",
      "his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;\n",
      "and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\" said he, at the conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,\n",
      "from his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\" said she, \"we are detaining\n",
      "the girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma, \"but you must\n",
      "not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\n",
      "account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"--\n",
      "though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very\n",
      "different conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer\n",
      "in a manner that appropriated nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,\"\n",
      "was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,\n",
      "and meant only for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr. Weston's\n",
      "quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\n",
      "Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\n",
      "a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish\n",
      "as before.  When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at\n",
      "least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet,\n",
      "she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\"--\n",
      "was a question, however, which did not augur much.\n",
      "\n",
      "But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,\n",
      "and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come\n",
      "in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's\n",
      "faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve\n",
      "o'clock, that she was to think of her at four.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, dear anxious friend,\"--said she, in mental soliloquy,\n",
      "while walking downstairs from her own room, \"always overcareful\n",
      "for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your\n",
      "little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure\n",
      "that all is right.\"  The clock struck twelve as she passed through\n",
      "the hall.  \"'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four\n",
      "hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later,\n",
      "I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.\n",
      "I am sure they will bring him soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with\n",
      "her father--Mr. Weston and his son.  They had been arrived only\n",
      "a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation\n",
      "of Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet\n",
      "in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when\n",
      "she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,\n",
      "was actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did\n",
      "not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good\n",
      "looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable,\n",
      "and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness\n",
      "of his father's; he looked quick and sensible.  She felt immediately\n",
      "that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner,\n",
      "and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending\n",
      "to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had reached Randalls the evening before.  She was pleased\n",
      "with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan,\n",
      "and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half\n",
      "a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you yesterday,\" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \"I told\n",
      "you all that he would be here before the time named.  I remembered\n",
      "what I used to do myself.  One cannot creep upon a journey;\n",
      "one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the\n",
      "pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins,\n",
      "is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\" said the young man,\n",
      "\"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\n",
      "but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\n",
      "Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;\n",
      "the conviction was strengthened by what followed.  He was very much\n",
      "pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,\n",
      "would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,\n",
      "the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,\n",
      "and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest\n",
      "in the country which none but one's _own_ country gives, and the\n",
      "greatest curiosity to visit it.  That he should never have been\n",
      "able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously\n",
      "through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a\n",
      "pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.  His manner had no air of study\n",
      "or exaggeration.  He did really look and speak as if in a state of no\n",
      "common enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.\n",
      "On his side were the inquiries,--\"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--\n",
      "Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps,\n",
      "afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses\n",
      "in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\n",
      "proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,\n",
      "while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing\n",
      "his mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,\n",
      "so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she\n",
      "secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,\n",
      "as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--\n",
      "and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.\n",
      "He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be\n",
      "thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know\n",
      "very little of the matter.  He understood what would be welcome;\n",
      "he could be sure of little else.  \"His father's marriage,\" he said,\n",
      "\"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;\n",
      "and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must\n",
      "be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation\n",
      "on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,\n",
      "without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\n",
      "was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's\n",
      "character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved\n",
      "to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he\n",
      "wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he;\n",
      "\"but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected\n",
      "more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;\n",
      "I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\"\n",
      "said Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\n",
      "with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\n",
      "such words.  Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as\n",
      "a pretty young woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it,\n",
      "(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should\n",
      "understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought\n",
      "extravagant in my terms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\n",
      "from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession\n",
      "of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were\n",
      "to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.\n",
      "She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she\n",
      "only felt they were agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.\n",
      "His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them\n",
      "with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not\n",
      "to look, she was confident that he was often listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,\n",
      "the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration\n",
      "or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.  Happily he\n",
      "was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--\n",
      "Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,\n",
      "he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;\n",
      "it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons'\n",
      "understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were\n",
      "proved against them.  She blessed the favouring blindness.\n",
      "He could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise,\n",
      "without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest,\n",
      "give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous\n",
      "inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey,\n",
      "through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express\n",
      "very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped\n",
      "catching cold--which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite\n",
      "assured of himself till after another night.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going.\n",
      "He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\n",
      "for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.\"\n",
      "His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,\n",
      "saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the\n",
      "opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,\n",
      "and therefore may as well be paid now.  I have the honour of being\n",
      "acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady\n",
      "residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.\n",
      "I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;\n",
      "though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather\n",
      "say Barnes, or Bates.  Do you know any family of that name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure we do,\" cried his father; \"Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--\n",
      "I saw Miss Bates at the window.  True, true, you are acquainted\n",
      "with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine\n",
      "girl she is.  Call upon her, by all means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,\" said the\n",
      "young man; \"another day would do as well; but there was that degree\n",
      "of acquaintance at Weymouth which--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.  What is right to be done\n",
      "cannot be done too soon.  And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\n",
      "any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided.\n",
      "You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body\n",
      "she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,\n",
      "who has barely enough to live on.  If you do not call early it\n",
      "will be a slight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The son looked convinced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\" said Emma; \"she is\n",
      "a very elegant young woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He agreed to it, but with so quiet a \"Yes,\" as inclined her almost\n",
      "to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct\n",
      "sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could\n",
      "be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\"\n",
      "said she, \"I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;\n",
      "see her and hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,\n",
      "for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\"\n",
      "said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;\n",
      "\"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very\n",
      "agreeable young lady.  She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama\n",
      "and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.\n",
      "They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my\n",
      "servants shall go with you to shew you the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\n",
      "quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses;\n",
      "you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\n",
      "unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you\n",
      "where you had best cross the street.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\n",
      "and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \"My good friend,\n",
      "this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he\n",
      "sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown\n",
      "in a hop, step, and jump.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,\n",
      "and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.\n",
      "Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,\n",
      "and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of\n",
      "the day, with full confidence in their comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.  He came with\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.\n",
      "He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\n",
      "till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse\n",
      "their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--\"He did not doubt there\n",
      "being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him,\n",
      "he should always chuse the same.  Highbury, that airy, cheerful,\n",
      "happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction.\"--\n",
      "Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to\n",
      "its bearing the same construction with him.  They walked thither directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had hardly expected them:  for Mr. Weston, who had called in\n",
      "for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,\n",
      "knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize\n",
      "to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,\n",
      "arm in arm.  She was wanting to see him again, and especially\n",
      "to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom\n",
      "her opinion of him was to depend.  If he were deficient there,\n",
      "nothing should make amends for it.  But on seeing them together,\n",
      "she became perfectly satisfied.  It was not merely in fine words\n",
      "or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be\n",
      "more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could\n",
      "more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and\n",
      "securing her affection.  And there was time enough for Emma to form a\n",
      "reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.\n",
      "They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--\n",
      "first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.\n",
      "He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently\n",
      "for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,\n",
      "confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,\n",
      "and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma\n",
      "could have supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.\n",
      "He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,\n",
      "and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting\n",
      "that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\n",
      "of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though\n",
      "in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit,\n",
      "they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general,\n",
      "which must be very like a merit to those he was with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,\n",
      "it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\n",
      "absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making\n",
      "a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly\n",
      "had not done him justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,\n",
      "though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of\n",
      "post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood\n",
      "than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected\n",
      "to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they\n",
      "gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built\n",
      "many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been\n",
      "in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used\n",
      "as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the\n",
      "highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist\n",
      "club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.\n",
      "He was immediately interested.  Its character as a ball-room caught him;\n",
      "and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two\n",
      "superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate\n",
      "its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should\n",
      "have ceased.  He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge\n",
      "none which they suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough,\n",
      "handsome enough.  It would hold the very number for comfort.\n",
      "They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through\n",
      "the winter.  Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good\n",
      "old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!\n",
      "The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\n",
      "that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be\n",
      "tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.\n",
      "He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw\n",
      "around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting;\n",
      "and even when particulars were given and families described, he was\n",
      "still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture\n",
      "would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty\n",
      "in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.\n",
      "He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma\n",
      "was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail\n",
      "so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have\n",
      "all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations\n",
      "of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.\n",
      "Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference\n",
      "to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.\n",
      "He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\n",
      "It was but an effusion of lively spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\n",
      "and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,\n",
      "Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him\n",
      "if he had paid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, oh! yes\"--he replied; \"I was just going to mention it.\n",
      "A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very\n",
      "much obliged to you for your preparatory hint.  If the talking aunt\n",
      "had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.\n",
      "As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.\n",
      "Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that\n",
      "was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home\n",
      "before him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my\n",
      "utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)\n",
      "joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them\n",
      "very nearly three-quarters of an hour.  The good lady had not given me\n",
      "the possibility of escape before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill.\n",
      "But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\n",
      "Ladies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally\n",
      "so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--\n",
      "A most deplorable want of complexion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax's complexion.  \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she\n",
      "would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was\n",
      "a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance\n",
      "to the character of her face.\"  He listened with all due deference;\n",
      "acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he\n",
      "must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want\n",
      "of the fine glow of health.  Where features were indifferent,\n",
      "a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,\n",
      "the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the\n",
      "effect was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Emma, \"there is no disputing about taste.--At least\n",
      "you admire her except her complexion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head and laughed.--\"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax\n",
      "and her complexion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you see her often at Weymouth?  Were you often in the same society?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,\n",
      "\"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day\n",
      "of their lives, as my father informs me.  He comes to Highbury himself,\n",
      "he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.\n",
      "If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\n",
      "myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.\n",
      "I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--\n",
      "I dare say they sell gloves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.  I do admire your patriotism.\n",
      "You will be adored in Highbury.  You were very popular before you came,\n",
      "because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at\n",
      "Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \"Men's Beavers\"\n",
      "and \"York Tan\" were bringing down and displaying on the counter,\n",
      "he said--\"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking\n",
      "to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst\n",
      "of my _amor_ _patriae_.  Do not let me lose it.  I assure you the utmost\n",
      "stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any\n",
      "happiness in private life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax\n",
      "and her party at Weymouth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\n",
      "very unfair one.  It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree\n",
      "of acquaintance.  Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--\n",
      "I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.\n",
      "But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,\n",
      "she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least\n",
      "information about any body, that I really think you may say what you\n",
      "like of your acquaintance with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me\n",
      "so well.  I met her frequently at Weymouth.  I had known the Campbells\n",
      "a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\n",
      "Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\n",
      "warm-hearted woman.  I like them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she\n",
      "is destined to be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\" said Mrs. Weston smiling;\n",
      "\"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows\n",
      "what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life.\n",
      "I will move a little farther off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly do forget to think of _her_,\" said Emma, \"as having ever\n",
      "been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,\n",
      "\"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\"\n",
      "said Frank Churchill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ever hear her!\" repeated Emma.  \"You forget how much she belongs\n",
      "to Highbury.  I have heard her every year of our lives since we\n",
      "both began.  She plays charmingly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\n",
      "could really judge.  She appeared to me to play well, that is,\n",
      "with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--\n",
      "I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill\n",
      "or right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used\n",
      "to hear her's admired; and I remember one proof of her being\n",
      "thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love\n",
      "with another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--\n",
      "would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument,\n",
      "if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed\n",
      "to like to hear one if he could hear the other.  That, I thought,\n",
      "in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Proof indeed!\" said Emma, highly amused.--\"Mr. Dixon is very musical,\n",
      "is he?  We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\n",
      "than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought\n",
      "it a very strong proof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal\n",
      "stronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all\n",
      "agreeable to me.  I could not excuse a man's having more music\n",
      "than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine\n",
      "sounds than to my feelings.  How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was her very particular friend, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor comfort!\" said Emma, laughing.  \"One would rather have a stranger\n",
      "preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might\n",
      "not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\n",
      "always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--\n",
      "Poor Mrs. Dixon!  Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are right.  It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;\n",
      "but she really did not seem to feel it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which.\n",
      "But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship,\n",
      "or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have\n",
      "felt it:  Miss Fairfax herself.  She must have felt the improper\n",
      "and dangerous distinction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to that--I do not--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's\n",
      "sensations from you, or from any body else.  They are known to no\n",
      "human being, I guess, but herself.  But if she continued to play\n",
      "whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\"\n",

      "\"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--\"\n",

      "is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--\n",
      "how it might all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there\n",
      "was smoothness outwardly.  But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from\n",
      "a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she\n",
      "is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\n",
      "and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should\n",
      "be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever\n",
      "she visited her friends.  But we never did.  I hardly know how it\n",
      "has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side\n",
      "which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized\n",
      "and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother,\n",
      "and all their set.  And then, her reserve--I never could attach\n",
      "myself to any one so completely reserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\" said he.  \"Oftentimes\n",
      "very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.  There is safety\n",
      "in reserve, but no attraction.  One cannot love a reserved person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\n",
      "may be the greater.  But I must be more in want of a friend,\n",
      "or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take\n",
      "the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.\n",
      "Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.\n",
      "I have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that\n",
      "such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,\n",
      "such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt\n",
      "to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He perfectly agreed with her:  and after walking together so long,\n",
      "and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\n",
      "that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.\n",
      "He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the\n",
      "world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune,\n",
      "therefore better than she had expected.  His ideas seemed more moderate--\n",
      "his feelings warmer.  She was particularly struck by his manner\n",
      "of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church,\n",
      "he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much\n",
      "fault with.  No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house\n",
      "as a man was to be pitied for having.  If it were to be shared with\n",
      "the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having\n",
      "that house.  There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.\n",
      "The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\n",
      "Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\n",
      "advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could\n",
      "be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.\n",
      "But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\n",
      "was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination\n",
      "to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.\n",
      "He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be\n",
      "occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry,\n",
      "but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make\n",
      "him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly\n",

      "Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken\n",
      "the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,\n",
      "merely to have his hair cut.  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him\n",
      "at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\n",
      "return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\n",
      "having his hair cut.  There was certainly no harm in his travelling\n",
      "sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air\n",
      "of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.  It did\n",
      "not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense,\n",
      "or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself\n",
      "to discern in him yesterday.  Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\n",
      "restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\n",
      "heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\n",
      "liable to all these charges.  His father only called him a coxcomb,\n",
      "and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it,\n",
      "was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,\n",
      "and making no other comment than that \"all young people would have\n",
      "their little whims.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\n",
      "hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.  Mrs. Weston\n",
      "was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he\n",
      "made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.\n",
      "He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful\n",
      "and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,\n",
      "a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard,\n",
      "was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the\n",
      "world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being\n",
      "attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,\n",
      "and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.\n",
      "This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy\n",
      "for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy\n",
      "of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;\n",
      "the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being\n",
      "at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference--\n",
      "(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short,\n",
      "of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\n",
      "have some weight.  He gave her to understand that Frank admired\n",
      "her extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming;\n",
      "and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must\n",
      "not judge him harshly.  As Mrs. Weston observed, \"all young people\n",
      "would have their little whims.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\n",
      "leniently disposed.  In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\n",
      "of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances\n",
      "were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--\n",
      "one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit\n",
      "among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows\n",
      "or smiles--Mr. Knightley.  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield;\n",
      "for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately\n",
      "afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,\n",
      "\"Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for.\"  She had\n",
      "half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced\n",
      "her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,\n",
      "and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect\n",
      "particularly opportune.  Something occurred while they were\n",
      "at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was\n",
      "still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years\n",
      "in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,\n",
      "and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,\n",
      "in trade, and only moderately genteel.  On their first coming into\n",
      "the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,\n",
      "keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last\n",
      "year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--\n",
      "the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general\n",
      "had smiled on them.  With their wealth, their views increased;\n",
      "their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.\n",
      "They added to their house, to their number of servants,\n",
      "to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune\n",
      "and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\n",
      "Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\n",
      "for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among\n",
      "the single men, had already taken place.  The regular and best\n",
      "families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--\n",
      "neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.  Nothing should\n",
      "tempt _her_ to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's\n",
      "known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she\n",
      "could wish.  The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they\n",
      "ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms\n",
      "on which the superior families would visit them.  This lesson,\n",
      "she very much feared, they would receive only from herself;\n",
      "she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many\n",
      "weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,\n",
      "it found her very differently affected.  Donwell and Randalls\n",
      "had received their invitation, and none had come for her father\n",
      "and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with \"I suppose\n",
      "they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not\n",
      "dine out,\" was not quite sufficient.  She felt that she should\n",
      "like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea\n",
      "of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those\n",
      "whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again,\n",
      "she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept.\n",
      "Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.  They had\n",
      "been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\n",
      "and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence.\n",
      "Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.\n",
      "The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;\n",
      "and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission\n",
      "to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were\n",
      "at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\n",
      "first remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\"\n",
      "she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\n",
      "that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\n",
      "without inclination for the party.  The Coles expressed themselves\n",
      "so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--\n",
      "so much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the\n",
      "honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen\n",
      "from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught\n",
      "of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\n",
      "honour of his company.\"  Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;\n",
      "and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be\n",
      "done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,\n",
      "if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's\n",
      "going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending\n",
      "the whole evening away from him.  As for _his_ going, Emma did\n",
      "not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late,\n",
      "and the party too numerous.  He was soon pretty well resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\" said he--\"I never was.\n",
      "No more is Emma.  Late hours do not agree with us.  I am sorry\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.  I think it would be\n",
      "much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,\n",
      "and take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;\n",
      "which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home\n",
      "without being out in the damp of the evening.  The dews of a summer\n",
      "evening are what I would not expose any body to.  However, as they\n",
      "are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you\n",
      "will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,\n",
      "I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,\n",
      "neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\"  Then turning to Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah!  Miss Taylor, if you had\n",
      "not married, you would have staid at home with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away,\n",
      "it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will\n",
      "step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\n",
      "not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation.  The ladies knew better\n",
      "how to allay it.  Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing\n",
      "deliberately arranged.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough\n",
      "for talking as usual.  \"He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard.\n",
      "He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,\n",
      "and invite her.  James could take the note.  But first of all,\n",
      "there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.  You will\n",
      "say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\n",
      "decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_,\n",
      "of course.  But you will do every thing right.  I need not tell you\n",
      "what is to be done.  We must remember to let James know that the carriage\n",
      "will be wanted on Tuesday.  I shall have no fears for you with him.\n",
      "We have never been there above once since the new approach was made;\n",
      "but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.\n",
      "And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would\n",
      "have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.\n",
      "You will not like staying late.  You will get very tired when tea\n",
      "is over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.  There will be\n",
      "a great many people talking at once.  You will not like the noise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"if Emma comes away early,\n",
      "it will be breaking up the party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And no great harm if it does,\" said Mr. Woodhouse.  \"The sooner\n",
      "every party breaks up, the better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.\n",
      "Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence.\n",
      "They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;\n",
      "but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no\n",
      "great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought\n",
      "of than any other person's in the room.  You would not wish to disappoint\n",
      "and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people\n",
      "as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged\n",
      "to you for reminding me.  I should be extremely sorry to be giving\n",
      "them any pain.  I know what worthy people they are.  Perry tells\n",
      "me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.  You would not think\n",
      "it to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.\n",
      "No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.  My dear Emma,\n",
      "we must consider this.  I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.\n",
      "You will not regard being tired.  You will be perfectly safe,\n",
      "you know, among your friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes, papa.  I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have\n",
      "no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.\n",
      "I am only afraid of your sitting up for me.  I am not afraid\n",
      "of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.\n",
      "She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid\n",
      "you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your\n",
      "usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.\n",
      "You must promise me not to sit up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He did, on the condition of some promises on her side:  such as that,\n",
      "if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;\n",
      "if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid\n",
      "should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see\n",

      "\n",
      "He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with\n",
      "a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed\n",

      "to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,\n",

      "the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake\n",
      "and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his\n",
      "care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise\n",
      "during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;\n",
      "she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased\n",
      "to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping\n",
      "no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health,\n",
      "activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get\n",
      "about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became\n",
      "the owner of Donwell Abbey.  She had an opportunity now of speaking\n",
      "her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is coming as you should do,\" said she; \"like a gentleman.--\n",
      "I am quite glad to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He thanked her, observing, \"How lucky that we should arrive at the same\n",
      "moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\n",
      "you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--\n",
      "You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes I should, I am sure I should.  There is always a look of\n",
      "consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know\n",
      "to be beneath them.  You think you carry it off very well, I dare say,\n",
      "but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern;\n",
      "I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.\n",
      "_Now_ you have nothing to try for.  You are not afraid of being\n",
      "supposed ashamed.  You are not striving to look taller than any\n",
      "body else.  _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same\n",
      "room with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsensical girl!\" was his reply, but not at all in anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party\n",
      "as with Mr. Knightley.  She was received with a cordial respect\n",
      "which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could\n",
      "wish for.  When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,\n",
      "the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;\n",
      "the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked\n",
      "her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated\n",
      "by her--and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity\n",
      "on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\n",
      "unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\n",
      "naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,\n",
      "the lawyer of Highbury.  The less worthy females were to come\n",
      "in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith;\n",
      "but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject\n",
      "of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton\n",
      "were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to\n",
      "the pleasantness of her neighbour.  The first remote sound to which\n",
      "she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.\n",
      "Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be\n",
      "very interesting.  She listened, and found it well worth listening to.\n",
      "That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.\n",
      "Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates,\n",
      "and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight\n",
      "of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand,\n",
      "but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story,\n",
      "the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,\n",
      "and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was,\n",
      "that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before,\n",
      "to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;\n",
      "that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at\n",
      "a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--\n",
      "but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only\n",
      "one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One can suppose nothing else,\" added Mrs. Cole, \"and I was only\n",
      "surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.  But Jane,\n",
      "it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said\n",
      "about it.  She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their\n",
      "silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.\n",
      "They might chuse to surprize her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\n",
      "subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\n",
      "and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there\n",
      "were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way,\n",
      "and still listen to Mrs. Cole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given\n",
      "me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,\n",
      "who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.\n",
      "It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses\n",
      "there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.\n",
      "This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was\n",
      "but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed\n",
      "to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I\n",
      "do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are\n",
      "but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;\n",
      "and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\n",
      "any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest\n",
      "old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this\n",
      "to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he\n",
      "is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging\n",
      "himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might\n",
      "be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;\n",
      "and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--\n",
      "or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great\n",
      "hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\n",
      "more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,\n",
      "turned to Frank Churchill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you smile?\" said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, why do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being\n",
      "so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I rather wonder that it was never made before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--\n",
      "which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large\n",
      "for Mrs. Bates's house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies\n",
      "that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know.  I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\n",
      "acuteness than I deserve.  I smile because you smile, and shall probably\n",
      "suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\n",
      "there is to question.  If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed.  I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.\n",
      "She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument\n",
      "would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,\n",
      "is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It\n",
      "is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.  I told you that your suspicions would\n",
      "guide mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon\n",
      "in them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Dixon.--Very well.  Yes, I immediately perceive that it must\n",
      "be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.  We were speaking the\n",
      "other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I\n",
      "had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good\n",
      "intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help\n",
      "suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,\n",
      "he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became\n",
      "conscious of a little attachment on her side.  One might guess\n",
      "twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure\n",
      "there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury\n",
      "instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.  Here, she must be\n",
      "leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been\n",
      "all enjoyment.  As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look\n",
      "upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed;\n",
      "but what can any body's native air do for them in the months\n",
      "of January, February, and March?  Good fires and carriages would\n",
      "be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I\n",
      "dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\n",
      "though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly\n",
      "tell you what they are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.\n",
      "Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer\n",
      "for being very decided.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And then, he saved her life.  Did you ever hear of that?--\n",
      "A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.\n",
      "He caught her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He did.  I was there--one of the party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,\n",
      "for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think\n",
      "I should have made some discoveries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,\n",
      "that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon\n",
      "caught her.--It was the work of a moment.  And though the consequent\n",
      "shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I\n",
      "believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--\n",
      "yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar\n",
      "anxiety to be observable.  I do not mean to say, however, that you\n",
      "might not have made discoveries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation was here interrupted.  They were called on to share\n",
      "in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,\n",
      "and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when\n",
      "the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\n",
      "exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,\n",
      "Emma said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.  I wanted to know\n",
      "a little more, and this tells me quite enough.  Depend upon it,\n",
      "we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we\n",
      "must conclude it to come from the Campbells.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.  Miss Fairfax knows it\n",
      "is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.\n",
      "She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.\n",
      "I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced\n",
      "myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.  Your reasonings\n",
      "carry my judgment along with them entirely.  At first, while I\n",
      "supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw\n",
      "it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing\n",
      "in the world.  But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more\n",
      "probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.\n",
      "And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no occasion to press the matter farther.  The conviction\n",
      "seemed real; he looked as if he felt it.  She said no more,\n",
      "other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away;\n",
      "the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked\n",
      "to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever\n",
      "things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion\n",
      "neither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks,\n",
      "dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,\n",
      "in their different divisions, arrived.  Emma watched the entree of her\n",
      "own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity\n",
      "and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the\n",
      "artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,\n",
      "unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations\n",
      "of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.\n",
      "There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had\n",
      "been lately shedding?  To be in company, nicely dressed herself\n",
      "and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty,\n",
      "and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.\n",
      "Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she\n",
      "might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad\n",
      "to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having\n",
      "loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous\n",
      "pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\n",
      "She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much\n",
      "in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity\n",
      "or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance;\n",
      "but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced,\n",
      "and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations\n",
      "were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of \"my\n",
      "excellent friend Colonel Campbell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\n",
      "by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\n",
      "perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask\n",
      "and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious\n",
      "of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she\n",
      "plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the\n",
      "early was Frank Churchill.  In he walked, the first and the handsomest;\n",
      "and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and\n",
      "her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\n",
      "where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\n",
      "would not sit at all.  Emma divined what every body present must\n",
      "be thinking.  She was his object, and every body must perceive it.\n",
      "She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient\n",
      "moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.  \"He had\n",
      "never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.\"\n",
      "And she, \"Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,\n",
      "but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\"\n",
      "Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\n",
      "glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\n",
      "He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--\n",
      "hated sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--\n",
      "that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left\n",
      "very busy over parish business--that as long as he had staid,\n",
      "however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general\n",
      "a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of\n",
      "Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--\n",
      "that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place\n",
      "rather too much.  She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--\n",
      "the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;\n",
      "and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe\n",
      "was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings\n",
      "were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even\n",
      "when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\n",
      "chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\n",
      "that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that,\n",
      "though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,\n",
      "without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away,\n",
      "or introduce an acquaintance for a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,\n",
      "taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more\n",
      "retirement at home than he liked.  His importance at Enscombe was\n",
      "very evident.  He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,\n",
      "that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,\n",
      "and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting\n",
      "one or two points) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing.\n",
      "One of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.\n",
      "He had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed\n",
      "to be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.  This had\n",
      "happened the year before.  _Now_, he said, he was beginning to have\n",
      "no longer the same wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed\n",
      "to be good behaviour to his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have made a most wretched discovery,\" said he, after a short pause.--\n",
      "\"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.  I never knew\n",
      "days fly so fast.  A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to\n",
      "enjoy myself.  But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--\n",
      "I hate the recollection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day,\n",
      "out of so few, in having your hair cut.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said he, smiling, \"that is no subject of regret at all.\n",
      "I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself\n",
      "fit to be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\n",
      "obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\n",
      "When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored\n",
      "as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room\n",
      "at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started.  \"Thank you for rousing me,\" he replied.  \"I believe\n",
      "I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair\n",
      "in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes\n",
      "from her.  I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must\n",
      "be a fancy of her own.  I see nobody else looking like her!--\n",
      "I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.  Shall I?--\n",
      "Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;--\n",
      "whether she colours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\n",
      "as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly\n",
      "in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get\n",
      "near every body, and say every thing.  My dear Emma, I am longing\n",
      "to talk to you.  I have been making discoveries and forming plans,\n",
      "just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.\n",
      "Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They walked, I conclude.  How else could they come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\n",
      "it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night,\n",
      "and cold as the nights are now.  And as I looked at her, though I\n",
      "never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she\n",
      "was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.\n",
      "Poor girl!  I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston\n",
      "came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about\n",
      "the carriage.  You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;\n",
      "and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates,\n",
      "to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took\n",
      "us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.\n",
      "Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.\n",
      "`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,\n",
      "many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.'  I was\n",
      "quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.\n",
      "Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--\n",
      "the sort of thing that so few men would think of.  And, in short,\n",
      "from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\n",
      "that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.\n",
      "I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself,\n",
      "and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely.  I know no man\n",
      "more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any\n",
      "thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.\n",
      "He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,\n",
      "considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case\n",
      "of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,\n",
      "there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at\n",
      "him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for\n",
      "more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;\n",
      "for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head,\n",
      "and I have never been able to get it out again.  The more I think\n",
      "of it, the more probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match\n",
      "between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.  See the consequence\n",
      "of keeping you company!--What do you say to it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\" exclaimed Emma.  \"Dear Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley\n",
      "must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--\n",
      "Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.  I cannot at all consent to\n",
      "Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.\n",
      "I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.\n",
      "I do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--\n",
      "but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley\n",
      "really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's\n",
      "account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I would.  I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--\n",
      "Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I\n",
      "cannot adopt it now.  And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you\n",
      "very well know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the imprudence of such a match!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation\n",
      "than what you mention.  His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you,\n",
      "would be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great\n",
      "regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--\n",
      "and is always glad to shew them attention.  My dear Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "do not take to match-making.  You do it very ill.  Jane Fairfax mistress\n",
      "of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.  For his own sake,\n",
      "I would not have him do so mad a thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.  Excepting inequality of fortune,\n",
      "and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.  I am sure he has not the\n",
      "least idea of it.  Do not put it into his head.  Why should he marry?--\n",
      "He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,\n",
      "and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely\n",
      "fond of his brother's children.  He has no occasion to marry,\n",
      "either to fill up his time or his heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\n",
      "loves Jane Fairfax--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!  He does not care about Jane Fairfax.  In the way\n",
      "of love, I am sure he does not.  He would do any good to her,\n",
      "or her family; but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he\n",
      "could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;\n",
      "a very shameful and degrading connexion.  How would he bear to have\n",
      "Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey,\n",
      "and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--\n",
      "`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very\n",
      "kind neighbour!'  And then fly off, through half a sentence,\n",
      "to her mother's old petticoat.  `Not that it was such a very old\n",
      "petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed,\n",
      "she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For shame, Emma!  Do not mimic her.  You divert me against\n",
      "my conscience.  And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would\n",
      "be much disturbed by Miss Bates.  Little things do not irritate him.\n",
      "She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would\n",
      "only talk louder, and drown her voice.  But the question is not,\n",
      "whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it;\n",
      "and I think he does.  I have heard him speak, and so must you,\n",
      "so very highly of Jane Fairfax!  The interest he takes in her--\n",
      "his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no\n",
      "happier prospect!  I have heard him express himself so warmly on\n",
      "those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,\n",
      "and of her voice!  I have heard him say that he could listen to her\n",
      "for ever.  Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\n",
      "to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--\n",
      "though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present\n",
      "from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?  I cannot\n",
      "help suspecting him.  I think he is just the person to do it,\n",
      "even without being in love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.\n",
      "But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\n",
      "oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\n",
      "course of things, occur to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have\n",
      "told her so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.  I have a very\n",
      "strong notion that it comes from him.  I am sure he was particularly\n",
      "silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\n",
      "many a time reproached me with doing.  I see no sign of attachment--\n",
      "I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince\n",
      "me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\n",
      "gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room\n",
      "shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--\n",
      "and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "would do them the honour of trying it.  Frank Churchill, of whom,\n",
      "in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been\n",
      "seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax,\n",
      "followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as,\n",
      "in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very\n",
      "proper compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt\n",
      "more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste\n",
      "nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,\n",
      "and could accompany her own voice well.  One accompaniment to her song\n",
      "took her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly\n",
      "taken by Frank Churchill.  Her pardon was duly begged at the close\n",
      "of the song, and every thing usual followed.  He was accused\n",
      "of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;\n",
      "which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,\n",
      "and had no voice at all, roundly asserted.  They sang together\n",
      "once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax,\n",
      "whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\n",
      "attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\n",
      "numbers round the instrument, to listen.  Frank Churchill sang again.\n",
      "They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.\n",
      "But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew\n",
      "away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking\n",
      "on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet\n",
      "sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.\n",
      "Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.\n",
      "She could see nothing but evil in it.  It would be a great\n",
      "disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.\n",
      "A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,\n",
      "and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her\n",
      "father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could not at all\n",
      "endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.  A Mrs. Knightley\n",
      "for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry.\n",
      "Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.\n",
      "They talked at first only of the performance.  His admiration\n",
      "was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "it would not have struck her.  As a sort of touchstone, however,\n",
      "she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece;\n",
      "and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,\n",
      "she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any\n",
      "kindness of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage\n",
      "more useful on such occasions.  It is not that I am without the wish;\n",
      "but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James\n",
      "should put-to for such a purpose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,\" he replied;--\n",
      "\"but you must often wish it, I am sure.\"  And he smiled with such\n",
      "seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This present from the Campbells,\" said she--\"this pianoforte\n",
      "is very kindly given.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--\n",
      "\"But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.\n",
      "Surprizes are foolish things.  The pleasure is not enhanced, and the\n",
      "inconvenience is often considerable.  I should have expected better\n",
      "judgment in Colonel Campbell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley\n",
      "had had no concern in giving the instrument.  But whether he\n",
      "were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there\n",
      "were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.\n",
      "Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\n",
      "\"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another song, however, was soon begged for.  \"One more;--they would\n",
      "not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for\n",
      "one more.\"  And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \"I think you could\n",
      "manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.\n",
      "The strength of the song falls on the second.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley grew angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That fellow,\" said he, indignantly, \"thinks of nothing but shewing\n",
      "off his own voice.  This must not be.\"  And touching Miss Bates,\n",
      "who at that moment passed near--\"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let\n",
      "your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?  Go, and interfere.\n",
      "They have no mercy on her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even\n",
      "to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all\n",
      "farther singing.  Here ceased the concert part of the evening,\n",
      "for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers;\n",
      "but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--\n",
      "originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted\n",
      "by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,\n",
      "to give proper space.  Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,\n",
      "was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill,\n",
      "coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand,\n",
      "and led her up to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\n",
      "Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\n",
      "voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "This would be a trial.  He was no dancer in general.  If he were to be\n",
      "very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.\n",
      "There was no immediate appearance.  No; he was talking to Mrs. Cole--\n",
      "he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\n",
      "and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;\n",
      "and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.\n",
      "Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the\n",
      "suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well\n",
      "matched in a partner.  They were a couple worth looking at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.\n",
      "It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home,\n",
      "on her mother's account.  After some attempts, therefore, to be\n",
      "permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "look sorrowful, and have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it is as well,\" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma\n",
      "to her carriage.  \"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid\n",
      "dancing would not have agreed with me, after your's.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.\n",
      "The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day;\n",
      "and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side\n",
      "of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour\n",
      "of popularity.  She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people,\n",
      "who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would\n",
      "not soon die away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were\n",
      "two points on which she was not quite easy.  She doubted whether\n",
      "she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying\n",
      "her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.\n",
      "It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it\n",
      "would escape her, and his submission to all that she told,\n",
      "was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult\n",
      "for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;\n",
      "and there she had no doubt.  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally\n",
      "regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing.  She did\n",
      "most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat\n",
      "down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's\n",
      "praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't class us together, Harriet.  My playing is no more like\n",
      "her's, than a lamp is like sunshine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two.  I think you play\n",
      "quite as well as she does.  I am sure I had much rather hear you.\n",
      "Every body last night said how well you played.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.\n",
      "The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\n",
      "but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,\n",
      "or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.\n",
      "Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked\n",
      "a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more\n",
      "than execution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you sure?  I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had\n",
      "any taste.  Nobody talked about it.  And I hate Italian singing.--\n",
      "There is no understanding a word of it.  Besides, if she does play\n",
      "so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,\n",
      "because she will have to teach.  The Coxes were wondering last night\n",
      "whether she would get into any great family.  How did you think the\n",
      "Coxes looked?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as they always do--very vulgar.\"\n",

      "the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise,\n",
      "or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest\n",
      "objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on\n",
      "the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from\n",
      "shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone,\n",
      "and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window\n",
      "eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,\n",
      "and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.\n",
      "A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see\n",
      "nothing that does not answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked down the Randalls road.  The scene enlarged;\n",
      "two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were\n",
      "walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.  They were stopping,\n",
      "however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was\n",
      "a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked,\n",
      "when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road\n",
      "and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's\n",
      "engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,\n",
      "in order to hear the new instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For my companion tells me,\" said she, \"that I absolutely promised\n",
      "Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.  I was\n",
      "not aware of it myself.  I did not know that I had fixed a day,\n",
      "but as he says I did, I am going now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\"\n",
      "said Frank Churchill, \"to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--\n",
      "if you are going home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you meant to go with me.  They would be very much pleased.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!  I should be quite in the way.  But, perhaps--I may be equally\n",
      "in the way here.  Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me.\n",
      "My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.  She says I fidget\n",
      "her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say\n",
      "the same.  What am I to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am here on no business of my own,\" said Emma; \"I am only waiting\n",
      "for my friend.  She will probably have soon done, and then we\n",
      "shall go home.  But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear\n",
      "the instrument.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell\n",
      "should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove\n",
      "to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?  I shall be no\n",
      "support to Mrs. Weston.  She might do very well by herself.\n",
      "A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I\n",
      "am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe any such thing,\" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded\n",
      "that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;\n",
      "but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.\n",
      "Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion\n",
      "last night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do come with me,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if it be not very disagreeable\n",
      "to you.  It need not detain us long.  We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\n",
      "We will follow them to Hartfield.  I really wish you to call with me.\n",
      "It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you\n",
      "meant it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\n",
      "returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door.  Emma watched them in,\n",
      "and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\n",
      "the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\n",
      "muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon,\n",
      "be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.\n",
      "At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?\" asked Mrs. Ford.--\n",
      "\"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is\n",
      "at Hartfield.  No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.\n",
      "But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the\n",
      "pattern gown home any day.  But I shall want the ribbon directly--\n",
      "so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon.  You could\n",
      "make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble\n",
      "of two parcels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No more it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No trouble in the world, ma'am,\" said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.\n",
      "Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--\n",
      "I do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well\n",
      "have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.\n",
      "What do you advise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you do not give another half-second to the subject.\n",
      "To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, that will be much best,\" said Harriet, quite satisfied,\n",
      "\"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies:\n",
      "Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Woodhouse,\" said the latter, \"I am just run across to\n",
      "entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\n",
      "and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.\n",
      "How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged\n",
      "Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, I am much obliged to you.  My mother is delightfully well;\n",
      "and Jane caught no cold last night.  How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\n",
      "to hear such a good account.  Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--\n",
      "Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will\n",
      "allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother\n",
      "will be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party,\n",
      "she cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill,\n",
      "`Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--\n",
      "But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go\n",
      "with me.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished\n",
      "my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,\n",
      "in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my\n",
      "mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.--\n",
      "So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--\n",
      "could not put them on.  And, by the bye, every body ought to have\n",
      "two pair of spectacles; they should indeed.  Jane said so.\n",
      "I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\n",
      "but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\n",
      "then another, there is no saying what, you know.  At one time Patty came\n",
      "to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping.  Oh, said I,\n",
      "Patty do not come with your bad news to me.  Here is the rivet\n",
      "of your mistress's spectacles out.  Then the baked apples came home,\n",
      "Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and\n",
      "obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people\n",
      "say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,\n",
      "but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention\n",
      "from them.  And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,\n",
      "for what is our consumption of bread, you know?  Only three of us.--\n",
      "besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such\n",
      "a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.\n",
      "I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one\n",
      "thing and then I say another, and it passes off.  But about the\n",
      "middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes\n",
      "so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\n",
      "for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry;\n",
      "I happened to meet him in the street.  Not that I had any doubt before--\n",
      "I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.\n",
      "I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the\n",
      "fruit thoroughly wholesome.  We have apple-dumplings, however,\n",
      "very often.  Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will\n",
      "oblige us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they\n",
      "did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss\n",
      "Bates than,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?  I beg your pardon.  I did not see\n",
      "you before.  I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons\n",
      "from town.  Jane came back delighted yesterday.  Thank ye,\n",
      "the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;\n",
      "but Jane is taking them in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were\n",
      "all in the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my\n",
      "mother's spectacles.  So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!\n",
      "`Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job\n",
      "of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so\n",
      "very. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him\n",
      "before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any\n",
      "thing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly.\n",
      "He seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!' said he,\n",
      "`I can fasten the rivet.  I like a job of that sort excessively.'\n",
      "I never shall forget his manner.  And when I brought out the baked\n",
      "apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\n",
      "obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing\n",
      "in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\n",
      "home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'  That, you know, was so\n",
      "very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.\n",
      "Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them\n",
      "full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,\n",
      "and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--\n",
      "but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.  The apples\n",
      "themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;\n",
      "all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.\n",
      "He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such\n",
      "a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there\n",
      "is two of them.  My mother says the orchard was always famous\n",
      "in her younger days.  But I was really quite shocked the other day--\n",
      "for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples,\n",
      "and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,\n",
      "and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.\n",
      "`I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I will send you\n",
      "another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.\n",
      "William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.\n",
      "I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.'\n",
      "So I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could\n",
      "not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half\n",
      "a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could\n",
      "not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he\n",
      "had been already; and Jane said the same.  And when he was gone,\n",
      "she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled,\n",
      "for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed\n",
      "that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had\n",
      "made him believe we had a great many left.  Oh, said I, my dear,\n",
      "I did say as much as I could.  However, the very same evening\n",
      "William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same\n",
      "sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,\n",
      "and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,\n",
      "as you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!\n",
      "I am always glad to see him.  But, however, I found afterwards\n",
      "from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort\n",
      "his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not\n",
      "one left to bake or boil.  William did not seem to mind it himself,\n",
      "he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,\n",
      "you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing;\n",
      "but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being\n",
      "all sent away.  She could not bear that her master should not be\n",
      "able to have another apple-tart this spring.  He told Patty this,\n",
      "but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us\n",
      "about it, for Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as\n",
      "so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.\n",
      "And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!\n",
      "I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for\n",
      "the world!  He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from\n",
      "Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was\n",
      "aware.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\n",
      "walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\n",
      "pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.\n",
      "Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--\n",
      "rather darker and narrower than one could wish.  Miss Smith,\n",
      "pray take care.  Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you\n",
      "hit your foot.  Miss Smith, the step at the turning.\"\n",

      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,\n",
      "was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\n",
      "slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table\n",
      "near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\n",
      "standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\n",
      "happy countenance on seeing Emma again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a pleasure,\" said he, in rather a low voice, \"coming at\n",
      "least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.  You find me\n",
      "trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" said Mrs. Weston, \"have not you finished it yet? you would\n",
      "not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not been working uninterruptedly,\" he replied, \"I have been\n",
      "assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\n",
      "it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.\n",
      "You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.  This was very kind\n",
      "of you to be persuaded to come.  I was almost afraid you would be\n",
      "hurrying home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\n",
      "employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying\n",
      "to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was\n",
      "quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.  That she was not\n",
      "immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;\n",
      "she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it\n",
      "without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;\n",
      "and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,\n",
      "and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,\n",
      "the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;\n",
      "Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every\n",
      "proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the\n",
      "highest promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\" said Frank Churchill,\n",
      "with a smile at Emma, \"the person has not chosen ill.  I heard a good\n",
      "deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the\n",
      "upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\n",
      "particularly prize.  I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave\n",
      "his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.\n",
      "Do not you think so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane did not look round.  She was not obliged to hear.  Mrs. Weston\n",
      "had been speaking to her at the same moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not fair,\" said Emma, in a whisper; \"mine was a random guess.\n",
      "Do not distress her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\n",
      "doubt and very little mercy.  Soon afterwards he began again,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure\n",
      "on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.  I dare say they often think of you,\n",
      "and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's\n",
      "coming to hand.  Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business\n",
      "to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be\n",
      "the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may\n",
      "have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time,\n",
      "to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused.  She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\" said she, in a voice\n",
      "of forced calmness, \"I can imagine nothing with any confidence.\n",
      "It must be all conjecture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes\n",
      "one conjectures wrong.  I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall\n",
      "make this rivet quite firm.  What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "when hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen,\n",
      "I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get\n",
      "hold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.\n",
      "There, it is done.  I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)\n",
      "of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape\n",
      "a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you are very kind,\" said he, \"it will be one of the waltzes\n",
      "we danced last night;--let me live them over again.  You did not\n",
      "enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.  I believe\n",
      "you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--\n",
      "all the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She played.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy!--\n",
      "If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\n",
      "something else.  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\n",
      "and turning to Emma, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is something quite new to me.  Do you know it?--Cramer.--\n",
      "And here are a new set of Irish melodies.  That, from such a quarter,\n",
      "one might expect.  This was all sent with the instrument.  Very thoughtful\n",
      "of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have\n",
      "no music here.  I honour that part of the attention particularly;\n",
      "it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.  Nothing hastily\n",
      "done; nothing incomplete.  True affection only could have prompted it.\"\n",

      "of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,\n",
      "she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction\n",

      "She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening\n",
      "the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention,\n",

      "\n",

      "Fairfax is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he\n",

      "still shook her head in steady scepticism.\n",

      "very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player,\n",
      "without exception, in England.  Now, if your friends have any gratitude,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To think of your sending us all your store apples.  You said you had\n",
      "a great many, and now you have not one left.  We really are so shocked!\n",

      "You should not have done it, indeed you should not.  Ah! he is off.\n",
      "He never can bear to be thanked.  But I thought he would have staid now,\n",
      "and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,\n",
      "(returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed.\n",

      "You must have heard every thing to be sure.  `Can I do any thing\n",
      "for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!\n",

      "obliging of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already\n",
      "lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was\n",
      "perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be possible to do without dancing entirely.  Instances have\n",
      "been known of young people passing many, many months successively,\n",
      "without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury\n",
      "accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--\n",
      "when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly,\n",
      "felt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\n",
      "and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\n",
      "to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\n",
      "people in schemes on the subject.  Frank's was the first idea;\n",
      "and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best\n",
      "judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation\n",
      "and appearance.  But still she had inclination enough for shewing\n",
      "people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare\n",
      "herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,\n",
      "without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first\n",
      "in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made\n",
      "to hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour,\n",
      "in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could\n",
      "say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's\n",
      "should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\n",
      "and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.\n",
      "Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,\n",
      "and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they\n",
      "could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed,\n",
      "of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the\n",
      "indispensable division of space to every couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two\n",
      "Miss Coxes five,\" had been repeated many times over.  \"And there\n",
      "will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself,\n",
      "besides Mr. Knightley.  Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.\n",
      "You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\n",
      "Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon it came to be on one side,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\n",
      "there will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On another,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth\n",
      "while to stand up.  Five couple are nothing, when one thinks\n",
      "seriously about it.  It will not do to _invite_ five couple.\n",
      "It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's,\n",
      "and must be invited with the rest.  Somebody else believed\n",
      "_Mrs_. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had\n",
      "been asked.  A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last,\n",
      "Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included,\n",
      "and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out,\n",
      "it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten,\n",
      "and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they\n",
      "could be disposed of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.\n",
      "\"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\"\n",
      "It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that\n",
      "many of them wanted a better.  Emma said it would be awkward;\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.  It made him so\n",
      "very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence.\n",
      "I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.  She would\n",
      "catch a dreadful cold.  So would poor little Harriet.\n",
      "So you would all.  Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up;\n",
      "do not let them talk of such a wild thing.  Pray do not let them\n",
      "talk of it.  That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.\n",
      "Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.\n",
      "He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping\n",
      "them open very inconsiderately.  He does not think of the draught.\n",
      "I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite\n",
      "the thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.  She knew the importance\n",
      "of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.  Every door\n",
      "was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme\n",
      "of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;\n",
      "and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space\n",
      "which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient\n",
      "for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough\n",
      "for ten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were too magnificent,\" said he.  \"We allowed unnecessary room.\n",
      "Ten couple may stand here very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma demurred.  \"It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could\n",
      "be worse than dancing without space to turn in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true,\" he gravely replied; \"it was very bad.\"  But still he\n",
      "went on measuring, and still he ended with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said she, \"you are quite unreasonable.  It would be dreadful\n",
      "to be standing so close!  Nothing can be farther from pleasure\n",
      "than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no denying it,\" he replied.  \"I agree with you exactly.\n",
      "A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\n",
      "pictures in a few words.  Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,\n",
      "having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.\n",
      "It would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do\n",
      "not know that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand\n",
      "here very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\n",
      "self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure\n",
      "of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave\n",
      "the rest.  Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been\n",
      "worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value\n",
      "of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for\n",
      "all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\n",
      "the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance\n",
      "of the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination\n",
      "for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the\n",
      "terrors of my father's little rooms.  I bring a new proposal\n",
      "on the subject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your\n",
      "approbation to be acted upon.  May I hope for the honour of your\n",
      "hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,\n",
      "to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Crown!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\n",
      "my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\n",
      "Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\n",
      "welcome than at Randalls.  It is his own idea.  Mrs. Weston sees\n",
      "no objection to it, provided you are satisfied.  This is what we\n",
      "all feel.  Oh! you were perfectly right!  Ten couple, in either of\n",
      "the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt\n",
      "how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing\n",
      "_any_ _thing_ to like to yield.  Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--\n",
      "I hope you consent?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston do not.  I think it admirable; and, as far as I can\n",
      "answer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement\n",
      "that could be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\n",
      "comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations\n",
      "were necessary to make it acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--\n",
      "much worse than the other.  A room at an inn was always damp\n",
      "and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.\n",
      "If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.  He had never\n",
      "been in the room at the Crown in his life--did not know the people\n",
      "who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan.  They would catch\n",
      "worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was going to observe, sir,\" said Frank Churchill,\n",
      "\"that one of the great recommendations of this change would\n",
      "be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--\n",
      "so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!  Mr. Perry\n",
      "might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sir,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \"you are very much\n",
      "mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.\n",
      "Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.  But I\n",
      "do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you\n",
      "than your father's house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.  We shall have\n",
      "no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening;\n",
      "and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold\n",
      "air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think\n",
      "of opening the windows at Randalls.  Nobody could be so imprudent!\n",
      "I never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open windows!--I am sure,\n",
      "neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)\n",
      "would suffer it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind\n",
      "a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.\n",
      "I have often known it done myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!  I never could have supposed it.\n",
      "But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.\n",
      "However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come\n",
      "to talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal\n",
      "of consideration.  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.\n",
      "If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,\n",
      "we may talk it over, and see what can be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" interrupted Emma, \"there will be plenty of time for talking\n",
      "every thing over.  There is no hurry at all.  If it can be contrived\n",
      "to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.\n",
      "They will be so near their own stable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So they will, my dear.  That is a great thing.  Not that James\n",
      "ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.\n",
      "If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is\n",
      "Mrs. Stokes to be trusted?  I doubt it.  I do not know her,\n",
      "even by sight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will\n",
      "be under Mrs. Weston's care.  Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct\n",
      "the whole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "who is carefulness itself.  Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said,\n",
      "so many years ago, when I had the measles?  `If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes\n",
      "to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'  How often\n",
      "have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, very true.  Mr. Perry did say so.  I shall never forget it.\n",
      "Poor little Emma!  You were very bad with the measles; that is,\n",
      "you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention.\n",
      "He came four times a day for a week.  He said, from the first,\n",
      "it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles\n",
      "are a dreadful complaint.  I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones\n",
      "have the measles, she will send for Perry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\"\n",
      "said Frank Churchill, \"examining the capabilities of the house.\n",
      "I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,\n",
      "and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice\n",
      "on the spot.  I was desired to say so from both.  It would be the\n",
      "greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.\n",
      "They can do nothing satisfactorily without you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\n",
      "engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young\n",
      "people set off together without delay for the Crown.  There were\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation,\n",
      "very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some\n",
      "little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma,\" said she, \"this paper is worse than I expected.\n",
      "Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot\n",
      "is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband.  \"What does\n",
      "all that signify?  You will see nothing of it by candlelight.\n",
      "It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.  We never see any\n",
      "thing of it on our club-nights.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \"Men never\n",
      "know when things are dirty or not;\" and the gentlemen perhaps\n",
      "thought each to himself, \"Women will have their little nonsenses\n",
      "and needless cares.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\n",
      "It regarded a supper-room.  At the time of the ballroom's being built,\n",
      "suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining,\n",
      "was the only addition.  What was to be done?  This card-room would\n",
      "be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted\n",
      "unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for\n",
      "any comfortable supper?  Another room of much better size might be\n",
      "secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,\n",
      "and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.\n",
      "This made a difficulty.  Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts\n",
      "for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the\n",
      "gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded\n",
      "at supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\n",
      "&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a\n",
      "wretched suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper,\n",
      "was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;\n",
      "and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.  She then took another\n",
      "line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.  We shall not be many,\n",
      "you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\n",
      "through the passage, was calling out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.\n",
      "It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from\n",
      "the stairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"one could know which arrangement our\n",
      "guests in general would like best.  To do what would be most generally\n",
      "pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very true,\" cried Frank, \"very true.  You want your neighbours'\n",
      "opinions.  I do not wonder at you.  If one could ascertain what the\n",
      "chief of them--the Coles, for instance.  They are not far off.\n",
      "Shall I call upon them?  Or Miss Bates?  She is still nearer.--\n",
      "And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand\n",
      "the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.  I think\n",
      "we do want a larger council.  Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates\n",
      "to join us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--if you please,\" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \"if you\n",
      "think she will be of any use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\" said Emma.\n",
      "\"She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.\n",
      "She will not even listen to your questions.  I see no advantage in\n",
      "consulting Miss Bates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!  I am very fond\n",
      "of hearing Miss Bates talk.  And I need not bring the whole family,\n",
      "you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,\n",
      "gave it his decided approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter\n",
      "at once.  She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know\n",
      "a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.\n",
      "Fetch Miss Bates.  We are growing a little too nice.  She is\n",
      "a standing lesson of how to be happy.  But fetch them both.\n",
      "Invite them both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Both sir!  Can the old lady?\" . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The old lady!  No, the young lady, to be sure.  I shall think you\n",
      "a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  I beg your pardon, sir.  I did not immediately recollect.\n",
      "Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\"\n",
      "And away he ran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\n",
      "and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered\n",
      "woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again,\n",
      "and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--\n",
      "indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.\n",
      "All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.\n",
      "All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music,\n",
      "tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles\n",
      "to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--\n",
      "Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written\n",
      "to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\n",
      "which could not possibly be refused.  And a delightful dance it was\n",
      "to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\n",
      "As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much\n",
      "safer character,) she was truly welcome.  Her approbation, at once\n",
      "general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;\n",
      "and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro,\n",
      "between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending,\n",
      "and all in happy enjoyment of the future.  The party did not break\n",
      "up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances\n",
      "by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston\n",
      "whisper to his wife, \"He has asked her, my dear.  That's right.\n",
      "I knew he would!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball\n",
      "completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within\n",
      "the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite\n",
      "of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible\n",
      "that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain\n",
      "a day beyond his fortnight.  But this was not judged feasible.\n",
      "The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly\n",
      "ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they\n",
      "must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--\n",
      "in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.\n",
      "His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was\n",
      "not opposed.  All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\n",
      "solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain\n",
      "of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "provoking indifference about it.  Either because he did not\n",
      "dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his\n",
      "being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,\n",
      "determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording\n",
      "him any future amusement.  To her voluntary communications Emma\n",
      "could get no more approving reply, than,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well.  If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\n",
      "trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing\n",
      "to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--\n",
      "Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep\n",
      "as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over\n",
      "William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.--\n",
      "Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--\n",
      "I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,\n",
      "must be its own reward.  Those who are standing by are usually\n",
      "thinking of something very different.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.\n",
      "It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was\n",
      "so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings\n",
      "in reprobating the ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it\n",
      "to an extraordinary degree.  It made her animated--open hearted--\n",
      "she voluntarily said;--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\n",
      "What a disappointment it would be!  I do look forward to it, I own,\n",
      "with _very_ great pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\n",
      "preferred the society of William Larkins.  No!--she was more and more\n",
      "convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.\n",
      "There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment\n",
      "on his side--but no love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the\n",
      "over-throw of every thing.  A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill\n",
      "to urge his nephew's instant return.  Mrs. Churchill was unwell--\n",
      "far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering\n",
      "state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,\n",
      "though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant\n",
      "habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;\n",
      "but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off\n",
      "for Enscombe without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note\n",
      "from Mrs. Weston, instantly.  As to his going, it was inevitable.\n",
      "He must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real\n",
      "alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance.  He knew her illnesses;\n",
      "they never occurred but for her own convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston added, \"that he could only allow himself time to\n",
      "hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few\n",
      "friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;\n",
      "and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.  When once\n",
      "it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament\n",
      "and exclaim.  The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--\n",
      "and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--\n",
      "Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!\n",
      "and she and her partner the happiest!--\"I said it would be so,\"\n",
      "was the only consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father's feelings were quite distinct.  He thought principally\n",
      "of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated;\n",
      "and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;\n",
      "but they would all be safer at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared;\n",
      "but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful\n",
      "look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.\n",
      "He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.  His dejection\n",
      "was most evident.  He sat really lost in thought for the first\n",

      "at Highbury!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you do us such ample justice now,\" said Emma, laughing, \"I will\n",

      "Do not we rather surpass your expectations?  I am sure we do.\n",
      "I am sure you did not much expect to like us.  You would not have been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes; my father is to join me here:  we shall walk back together,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better.\n",
      "It was a right thing to do.  I went in for three minutes, and was\n",
      "detained by Miss Bates's being absent.  She was out; and I felt it\n",
      "impossible not to wait till she came in.  She is a woman that one may,\n",
      "that one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.\n",
      "It was better to pay my visit, then\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\n",

      "hardly be quite without suspicion\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.  She hardly\n",
      "knew what to say.  It seemed like the forerunner of something\n",
      "absolutely serious, which she did not wish.  Forcing herself\n",
      "to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent.  She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\n",
      "on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.\n",
      "She heard him sigh.  It was natural for him to feel that he had\n",
      "_cause_ to sigh.  He could not believe her to be encouraging him.\n",
      "A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more\n",
      "determined manner said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be\n",
      "given to Hartfield.  My regard for Hartfield is most warm\"--\n",

      "how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made\n",
      "him composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.\n",
      "Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as\n",
      "incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable,\n",
      "as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, \"It was time to go;\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I shall hear about you all,\" said he; \"that is my chief consolation.\n",
      "I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.  I have\n",

      "felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little\n",
      "society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry,\n",
      "and feeling it too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sad change.  They had been meeting almost every day\n",

      "the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,\n",
      "the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!\n",
      "It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking\n",
      "from it into the common course of Hartfield days.  To complete every\n",
      "other recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her.\n",
      "What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,\n",
      "was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having\n",
      "a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;\n",
      "and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that\n",
      "she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous\n",
      "determination against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly must,\" said she.  \"This sensation of listlessness,\n",
      "weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\n",
      "this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--\n",
      "I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\n",

      "she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the\n",
      "first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;\n",
      "she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could\n",
      "yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him\n",
      "so much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand\n",

      "fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;\n",
      "the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she\n",
      "_refused_ _him_.  Their affection was always to subside into friendship.\n",
      "Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting;\n",
      "but still they were to part.  When she became sensible of this,\n",
      "it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite\n",
      "of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father,\n",
      "never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more\n",

      "is not really necessary to my happiness.  So much the better.\n",
      "I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.  I am\n",
      "quite enough in love.  I should be sorry to be more.\"\n",

      "inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.\n",
      "Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto.\n",
      "No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would\n",

      "I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--\n",
      "His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--\n",
      "Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful\n",
      "that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well\n",
      "again after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;\n",

      "When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;\n",
      "and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made\n",
      "her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she\n",
      "had undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter,\n",
      "giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,\n",
      "expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was\n",
      "natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local\n",
      "that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.\n",
      "No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the\n",
      "language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition\n",
      "from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some\n",
      "of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on\n",
      "to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been\n",
      "said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own\n",
      "name was not wanting.  _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once,\n",
      "and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\n",
      "compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;\n",
      "and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it\n",
      "was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern\n",
      "the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment\n",
      "perhaps of all conveyed.  Compressed into the very lowest vacant\n",
      "corner were these words--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,\n",
      "as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.  Pray make\n",
      "my excuses and adieus to her.\"  This, Emma could not doubt, was all\n",
      "for herself.  Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend.\n",
      "His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor\n",
      "better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,\n",
      "and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for\n",
      "coming to Randalls again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the\n",
      "material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up\n",
      "and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,\n",
      "that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn\n",
      "to do without her.  Her intentions were unchanged.  Her resolution\n",
      "of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for\n",
      "his subsequent consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet,\n",
      "and the words which clothed it, the \"beautiful little friend,\"\n",
      "suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections.\n",
      "Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his\n",
      "inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with\n",
      "the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;\n",
      "and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in\n",
      "her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must not dwell upon it,\" said she.--\"I must not think of it.\n",
      "I know the danger of indulging such speculations.  But stranger\n",
      "things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other\n",
      "as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort\n",
      "of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward\n",
      "to with pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf,\n",
      "though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil\n",
      "in that quarter was at hand.  As Frank Churchill's arrival had\n",
      "succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,\n",
      "as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now\n",
      "upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were\n",
      "assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.\n",
      "He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.\n",
      "There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe\n",
      "before \"Mr. Elton and his bride\" was in every body's mouth,\n",
      "and Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma grew sick at the sound.\n",
      "She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;\n",
      "and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately\n",
      "gaining strength.  With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,\n",
      "there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;\n",
      "but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state\n",
      "of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,\n",
      "bell-ringing, and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\n",
      "reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma\n",
      "could give.  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,\n",
      "that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;\n",
      "but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing\n",
      "any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions\n",
      "the same.  Harriet listened submissively, and said \"it was very true--\n",
      "it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to\n",
      "think about them--and she would not think about them any longer\"\n",
      "but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour\n",
      "saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.\n",
      "At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about\n",
      "Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can\n",
      "make _me_.  You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I\n",
      "fell into.  It was all my doing, I know.  I have not forgotten it,\n",
      "I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--\n",
      "and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.  Do not imagine\n",
      "me in danger of forgetting it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words\n",
      "of eager exclamation.  Emma continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,\n",
      "talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,\n",
      "I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important\n",
      "than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration\n",
      "of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour\n",
      "to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,\n",
      "and restore your tranquillity.  These are the motives which I\n",
      "have been pressing on you.  They are very important--and sorry\n",
      "I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.\n",
      "My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.  I want\n",
      "you to save yourself from greater pain.  Perhaps I may sometimes\n",
      "have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather\n",
      "what would be kind by me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.\n",
      "The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,\n",
      "and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained\n",
      "powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it\n",
      "very tolerably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--\n",

      "as I do for you!--Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look\n",
      "and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet\n",
      "so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\" said she\n",
      "afterwards to herself.  \"There is nothing to be compared to it.\n",
      "Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,\n",
      "will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,\n",
      "I am sure it will.  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear\n",
      "father so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--\n",
      "I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is\n",
      "my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.\n",
      "Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,\n",
      "longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.  Oh! the coldness\n",
      "of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--\n",
      "a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.  I mention no names;\n",

      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might\n",
      "be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,\n",
      "and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,\n",
      "to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,\n",
      "or not pretty at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,\n",
      "to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;\n",
      "and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of\n",
      "the business might be gone through as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room\n",
      "to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,\n",
      "to lace up her boot, without _recollecting_.  A thousand vexatious\n",
      "thoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;\n",
      "and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be\n",
      "recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather\n",
      "pale and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so\n",
      "much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma\n",
      "would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,\n",
      "and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms\n",
      "of being \"elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\n",
      "but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\n",
      "She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,\n",
      "there was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face\n",
      "not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,\n",
      "were elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would\n",
      "not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.\n",
      "It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,\n",
      "and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.\n",
      "The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,\n",
      "and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own\n",
      "good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly\n",
      "unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with\n",
      "the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,\n",
      "and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him\n",
      "to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,\n",
      "and as little really easy as could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted\n",
      "the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;\n",
      "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--\n",
      "Is not she very charming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;\n",
      "and she came in his way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say,\" returned Harriet, sighing again, \"I dare say she\n",
      "was very much attached to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the\n",
      "woman who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,\n",
      "and thought this the best offer she was likely to have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harriet earnestly, \"and well she might, nobody could ever\n",
      "have a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.\n",
      "He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,\n",
      "it is quite a different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need\n",
      "not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.\n",
      "To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--\n",
      "She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.\n",
      "Happy creature!  He called her `Augusta.'  How delightful!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then\n",
      "see more and judge better.  From Harriet's happening not to be\n",
      "at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,\n",
      "she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,\n",
      "and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite\n",
      "convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well\n",
      "satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;\n",
      "that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which\n",
      "had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her\n",
      "notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;\n",
      "that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would\n",
      "certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined herself,\n",
      "she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,\n",
      "it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best\n",
      "of her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride\n",
      "of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride\n",
      "of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \"My brother\n",
      "Mr. Suckling's seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.\n",
      "The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the\n",
      "house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably\n",
      "impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she\n",
      "could see or imagine.  \"Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite\n",
      "struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size\n",
      "of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.\"--\n",
      "Mr. Elton was appealed to.--\"Was not it astonishingly like?--\n",
      "She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like\n",
      "the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.\n",
      "I really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so\n",
      "extremely partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy\n",
      "months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,\n",
      "undoubtedly.  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;\n",
      "but to me, it has been quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted,\n",
      "like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it\n",
      "is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.\n",
      "I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\n",
      "for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--\n",
      "the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly\n",
      "like.  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here,\n",
      "and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;\n",
      "and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,\n",
      "which put me so exactly in mind!  My brother and sister will be\n",
      "enchanted with this place.  People who have extensive grounds\n",
      "themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea\n",
      "that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little\n",
      "for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth\n",
      "while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said\n",
      "in reply,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\n",
      "you have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England,\n",
      "you know.  Surry is the garden of England.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.\n",
      "Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,\n",
      "as well as Surry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I fancy not,\" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\"\n",
      "I never heard any county but Surry called so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was silenced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,\n",
      "or summer at farthest,\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"and that will be\n",
      "our time for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore\n",
      "a great deal, I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau,\n",
      "of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying\n",
      "any thing of _our_ carriage, we should be able to explore the different\n",
      "beauties extremely well.  They would hardly come in their chaise,\n",
      "I think, at that season of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on,\n",
      "I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;\n",
      "it will be so very much preferable.  When people come into a beautiful\n",
      "country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes\n",
      "them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond\n",
      "of exploring.  We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer,\n",
      "in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the\n",
      "barouche-landau.  You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very\n",
      "striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;\n",
      "and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed\n",
      "to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.\n",
      "Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite\n",
      "a proverb for it at Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said,\n",
      "when she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl\n",
      "to move from the house.  I absolutely must go in by myself, though I\n",
      "hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;\n",
      "but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir\n",
      "beyond the park paling.'  Many a time has she said so; and yet I\n",
      "am no advocate for entire seclusion.  I think, on the contrary,\n",
      "when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\n",
      "bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\n",
      "a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.\n",
      "I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--\n",
      "(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must\n",
      "be a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should.\n",
      "Let me recommend Bath to you.  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving\n",
      "any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown\n",
      "to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be\n",
      "useful now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief\n",
      "they give.  In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!\n",
      "And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of\n",
      "use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes\n",
      "much depressed.  And as to its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I\n",
      "need not take much pains to dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath\n",
      "to the young are pretty generally understood.  It would be a charming\n",
      "introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could\n",
      "immediately secure you some of the best society in the place.\n",
      "A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my\n",
      "particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided\n",
      "with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,\n",
      "and would be the very person for you to go into public with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.\n",
      "The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called\n",
      "an _introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices\n",
      "of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,\n",
      "who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--\n",
      "The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\n",
      "have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going\n",
      "to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly\n",
      "convinced that the place might suit her better than her father.\"\n",
      "And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the\n",
      "subject directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these occasions,\n",
      "a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long\n",
      "known that you are a superior performer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.\n",
      "A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.\n",
      "Consider from how partial a quarter your information came.\n",
      "I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends\n",
      "say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,\n",
      "upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree.\n",
      "You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.  I assure you\n",
      "it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,\n",
      "to hear what a musical society I am got into.  I absolutely cannot\n",
      "do without music.  It is a necessary of life to me; and having always\n",
      "been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,\n",
      "it would have been a most serious sacrifice.  I honestly said as much\n",
      "to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing\n",
      "his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;\n",
      "and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been\n",
      "accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\n",
      "When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n",
      "_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear\n",
      "of retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself,\n",
      "the world was not necessary to _me_.  I could do very well without it.\n",
      "To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my\n",
      "resources made me quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms\n",
      "than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought.\n",
      "I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.\n",
      "Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I\n",
      "did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,\n",
      "nor were spacious apartments.  `But,' said I, `to be quite honest,\n",
      "I do not think I can live without something of a musical society.\n",
      "I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank\n",
      "to me.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot suppose,\" said Emma, smiling, \"that Mr. Elton would hesitate\n",
      "to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury;\n",
      "and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than\n",
      "may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted\n",
      "to find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet\n",
      "little concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I\n",
      "must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings\n",
      "at your house, or ours.  Will not it be a good plan?  If _we_\n",
      "exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.\n",
      "Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_,\n",
      "as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--\n",
      "there is a sad story against them, in general.  They are but too apt\n",
      "to give up music.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can\n",
      "be no danger, surely?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\n",
      "I tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music--never touches\n",
      "the instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be said\n",
      "of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,\n",
      "now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.\n",
      "Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used to be\n",
      "quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend\n",
      "that a married woman has many things to call her attention.\n",
      "I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But every thing of that kind,\" said Emma, \"will soon\n",
      "be in so regular a train--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \"we shall see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,\n",
      "had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton\n",
      "chose another subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them\n",
      "both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.\n",
      "I like them extremely.  Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--\n",
      "quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.\n",
      "And _she_ appears so truly good--there is something so motherly\n",
      "and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.\n",
      "She was your governess, I think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton\n",
      "hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her\n",
      "so very lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Weston's manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good.\n",
      "Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\n",
      "model for any young woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who do you think came in while we were there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance--\n",
      "and how could she possibly guess?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knightley!\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"Knightley himself!--Was not\n",
      "it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,\n",
      "I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a\n",
      "friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.  `My friend Knightley'\n",
      "had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;\n",
      "and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not\n",
      "be ashamed of his friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman.\n",
      "I like him very much.  Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma\n",
      "could breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Insufferable woman!\" was her immediate exclamation.  \"Worse than I\n",
      "had supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not\n",
      "have believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,\n",
      "and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!\n",
      "A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_,\n",
      "and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and\n",
      "underbred finery.  Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is\n",
      "a gentleman!  I doubt whether he will return the compliment,\n",
      "and discover her to be a lady.  I could not have believed it!\n",
      "And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!\n",
      "One would fancy we were bosom friends!  And Mrs. Weston!--\n",
      "Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be\n",
      "a gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal.\n",
      "Much beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.\n",
      "Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?\n",
      "How angry and how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--\n",
      "thinking of him directly.  Always the first person to be thought of!\n",
      "How I catch myself out!  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into\n",
      "my mind!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time\n",
      "her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'\n",
      "departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable\n",
      "of attending.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear,\" he deliberately began, \"considering we never saw\n",
      "her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say\n",
      "she was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick.\n",
      "A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.\n",
      "But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks\n",
      "like you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,\n",
      "pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.\n",
      "Though I think he had better not have married.  I made the best\n",
      "excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton\n",
      "on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course\n",
      "of the summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon\n",
      "a bride is very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!\n",
      "But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects\n",
      "to her if possible.  It was being very deficient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore\n",
      "why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?\n",
      "It ought to be no recommendation to _you_.  It is encouraging people\n",
      "to marry if you make so much of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would\n",
      "always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,\n",
      "especially, is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to _her_.\n",
      "A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,\n",
      "let the others be who they may.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know\n",
      "what is.  And I should never have expected you to be lending your\n",
      "sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a\n",
      "matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,\n",
      "and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not\n",
      "understand _her_.  Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences,\n",
      "and long, very long, did they occupy her.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\n",
      "opinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct.\n",
      "Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,\n",
      "such she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,\n",
      "familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a\n",
      "little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself\n",
      "coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve\n",
      "a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held\n",
      "such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\n",
      "from his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.\n",
      "He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such\n",
      "a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;\n",
      "and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,\n",
      "or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's\n",
      "good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever\n",
      "and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;\n",
      "so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it\n",
      "ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her\n",
      "first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being \"very\n",
      "pleasant and very elegantly dressed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared\n",
      "at first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,\n",
      "by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,\n",
      "she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold\n",
      "and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will\n",
      "which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike.\n",
      "Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.\n",
      "They were sneering and negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work\n",
      "Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour\n",
      "sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor\n",
      "Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,\n",
      "and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable\n",
      "to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been\n",
      "given also.  She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--\n",
      "When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin\n",
      "abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew\n",
      "in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous\n",
      "treatment of Harriet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.\n",
      "Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be\n",
      "supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she\n",
      "was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--\n",
      "but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting\n",
      "to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,\n",
      "and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's\n",
      "knight-errantry on the subject.--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite\n",
      "rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.  So mild\n",
      "and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she\n",
      "has very extraordinary talents.  I do not scruple to say that she\n",
      "plays extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly\n",
      "on that point.  Oh! she is absolutely charming!  You will laugh at\n",
      "my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--\n",
      "And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.\n",
      "We must bring her forward.  Such talent as hers must not be suffered\n",
      "to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of\n",
      "the poet,\n",
      "\n",
      "        `Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\n",
      "          `And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot think there is any danger of it,\" was Emma's calm answer--\n",
      "\"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation\n",
      "and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,\n",
      "I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,\n",
      "such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have\n",
      "enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!  And I think\n",
      "she feels it.  I am sure she does.  She is very timid and silent.\n",
      "One can see that she feels the want of encouragement.  I like her\n",
      "the better for it.  I must confess it is a recommendation to me.\n",
      "I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does\n",
      "not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,\n",
      "it is extremely prepossessing.  Oh!  I assure you, Jane Fairfax\n",
      "is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I\n",
      "can express.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any\n",
      "of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known\n",
      "her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare\n",
      "to act.  You and I need not be afraid.  If _we_ set the example,\n",
      "many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not\n",
      "our situations.  _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home,\n",
      "and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of\n",
      "Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be\n",
      "extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,\n",
      "as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax\n",
      "to partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of thing.  It is\n",
      "not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been used to.\n",
      "My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\n",
      "other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.\n",
      "Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--\n",
      "for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,\n",
      "in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--\n",
      "I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce\n",
      "her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,\n",
      "and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.\n",
      "My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt\n",
      "of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,\n",
      "of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come\n",
      "to us.  I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets\n",
      "a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,\n",
      "for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is\n",
      "highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they\n",
      "are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in\n",
      "the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Jane Fairfax!\"--thought Emma.--\"You have not deserved this.\n",
      "You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a\n",

      "of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'  Heavens!  Let me\n",
      "not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--\n",
      "But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness\n",
      "of that woman's tongue!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\n",
      "addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a \"dear Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse.\"  The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,\n",
      "and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\n",
      "friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very\n",
      "active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a\n",
      "general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for\n",
      "Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\n",
      "simplicity and warmth.  She was quite one of her worthies--\n",
      "the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished\n",
      "and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.\n",
      "Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept\n",
      "those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do.\n",
      "She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,\n",
      "spending a day with the Eltons!  This was astonishing!--She could not\n",
      "have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax\n",
      "could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!\" said she.--\"To chuse to remain\n",
      "here month after month, under privations of every sort!  And now\n",
      "to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury\n",

      "who have always loved her with such real, generous affection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\n",
      "were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells\n",
      "had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,\n",
      "and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.\n",
      "According to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had\n",
      "written most pressingly.  Would Jane but go, means were to be found,\n",
      "servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed\n",

      "\n",
      "\"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\n",
      "this invitation,\" was Emma's conclusion.  \"She must be under some\n",
      "sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.\n",
      "There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--\n",
      "She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_.  The decree is issued by somebody.\n",
      "But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a\n",
      "separate puzzle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,\n",
      "before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston\n",
      "ventured this apology for Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\n",
      "my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.\n",
      "Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,\n",
      "must be very tiresome.  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,\n",
      "before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are right, Mrs. Weston,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"Miss Fairfax\n",
      "is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\n",
      "Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have\n",
      "chosen her.  But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives\n",
      "attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;\n",
      "and she was herself struck by his warmth.  With a faint blush,\n",
      "she presently replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined,\n",
      "would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton's\n",
      "invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not wonder,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"if Miss Fairfax were to have\n",
      "been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness\n",
      "in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her.  Poor Miss Bates may\n",
      "very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\n",
      "appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,\n",
      "in spite of the very natural wish of a little change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\n",
      "minutes silence, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton\n",
      "does not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her.  We all know\n",
      "the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest\n",
      "spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond\n",
      "common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--\n",
      "a something more early implanted.  We cannot give any body the\n",
      "disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.\n",
      "We feel things differently.  And besides the operation of this,\n",
      "as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes\n",
      "Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,\n",
      "face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she\n",
      "has a claim to.  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell\n",
      "in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent\n",
      "her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not\n",
      "in consciousness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\" said Emma.\n",
      "Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy\n",
      "made her irresolute what else to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he replied, \"any body may know how highly I think of her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,\n",
      "but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--\n",
      "she hurried on--\"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself\n",
      "how highly it is.  The extent of your admiration may take you by\n",
      "surprize some day or other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\n",
      "leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,\n",
      "or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.  Mr. Cole\n",
      "gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did\n",
      "not herself know what to think.  In a moment he went on--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will never be, however, I can assure you.  Miss Fairfax,\n",
      "I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very\n",
      "sure I shall never ask her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased\n",
      "enough to exclaim,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.  I will say that for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner\n",
      "which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,\n",
      "for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.  What I said\n",
      "just now, meant nothing.  One says those sort of things, of course,\n",
      "without any idea of a serious meaning.  Oh! no, upon my word I have not\n",
      "the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.\n",
      "You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,\n",
      "if you were married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.  The result of his reverie was,\n",
      "\"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will\n",
      "ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,\n",
      "I assure you.\"  And soon afterwards, \"Jane Fairfax is a very charming\n",
      "young woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.  She has a fault.\n",
      "She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.\n",
      "\"Well,\" said she, \"and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very soon.  He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\n",
      "he asked my pardon and said no more.  Cole does not want to be wiser\n",
      "or wittier than his neighbours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser\n",
      "and wittier than all the world!  I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--\n",
      "what she calls them!  How can she find any appellation for them,\n",
      "deep enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can\n",
      "she do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane\n",
      "Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.  I can much more\n",
      "readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,\n",
      "than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over\n",
      "Mrs. Elton.  I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself\n",
      "the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any\n",
      "restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot\n",
      "imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\n",
      "with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\n",
      "continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\n",
      "her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\n",
      "exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jane Fairfax has feeling,\" said Mr. Knightley--\"I do not\n",
      "accuse her of want of feeling.  Her sensibilities, I suspect,\n",
      "are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,\n",
      "patience, self-controul; but it wants openness.  She is reserved,\n",
      "more reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an\n",
      "open temper.  No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,\n",
      "it had never entered my head.  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with\n",
      "her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Mrs. Weston,\" said Emma triumphantly when he left them,\n",
      "\"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied\n",
      "by the idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder\n",

      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,\n",
      "was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.  Dinner-parties and\n",
      "evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations\n",
      "flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending\n",
      "they were never to have a disengaged day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see how it is,\" said she.  \"I see what a life I am to lead\n",
      "among you.  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.\n",
      "We really seem quite the fashion.  If this is living in the country,\n",
      "it is nothing very formidable.  From Monday next to Saturday,\n",
      "I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer\n",
      "resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No invitation came amiss to her.  Her Bath habits made evening-parties\n",
      "perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste\n",
      "for dinners.  She was a little shocked at the want of two\n",
      "drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being\n",
      "no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge\n",
      "of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought\n",
      "to be arranged.  In the course of the spring she must return their\n",
      "civilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables\n",
      "should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs\n",
      "in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening\n",
      "than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round\n",
      "the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner\n",
      "at Hartfield for the Eltons.  They must not do less than others,\n",
      "or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable\n",
      "of pitiful resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had\n",
      "talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,\n",
      "and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom\n",
      "of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding\n",
      "who should do it for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the Eltons,\n",
      "it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--\n",
      "and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\n",
      "be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given\n",
      "with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly\n",
      "pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.\n",
      "\"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.\n",
      "She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\n",
      "wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.  If Miss Woodhouse\n",
      "would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.\"\n",
      "It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it\n",
      "possible enough for wishing.  She was delighted with the fortitude\n",
      "of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give\n",
      "up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\n",
      "very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\n",
      "Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had\n",
      "often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.  He had said\n",
      "that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody\n",
      "else paid her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is very true,\" said she, \"at least as far as relates to me,\n",
      "which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--\n",
      "and always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--\n",
      "She will never like me now.  I have neglected her too long.  But I\n",
      "will shew her greater attention than I have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every invitation was successful.  They were all disengaged and all happy.--\n",
      "The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.\n",
      "A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.  The two eldest little\n",
      "Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of\n",
      "some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,\n",
      "and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be\n",
      "the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did\n",
      "not allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were\n",
      "disturbed by its happening so.  Mr. Woodhouse considered eight\n",
      "persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--\n",
      "and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would\n",
      "be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even\n",
      "to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.\n",
      "\n",
      "She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,\n",
      "by representing that though he certainly would make them nine,\n",
      "yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be\n",
      "very immaterial.  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself,\n",
      "to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed\n",
      "to her instead of his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.\n",
      "John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town\n",
      "and must be absent on the very day.  He might be able to join them\n",
      "in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.  Mr. Woodhouse was quite\n",
      "at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys\n",
      "and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,\n",
      "removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley\n",
      "seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.\n",
      "Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited\n",
      "for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as elegant\n",
      "as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--\n",
      "wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss\n",
      "Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\n",
      "talk to her.  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning\n",
      "from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning\n",
      "to rain.  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,\n",
      "and he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I\n",
      "am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.\n",
      "I hope you turned directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went only to the post-office,\" said she, \"and reached home\n",
      "before the rain was much.  It is my daily errand.  I always fetch\n",
      "the letters when I am here.  It saves trouble, and is a something\n",
      "to get me out.  A walk before breakfast does me good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\n",
      "yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;\n",
      "and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.\n",
      "The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.\n",
      "When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are\n",
      "never worth going through the rain for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little blush, and then this answer,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of\n",
      "every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply\n",
      "growing older should make me indifferent about letters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indifferent!  Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\n",
      "Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\n",
      "positive curse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters\n",
      "of friendship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have often thought them the worst of the two,\" replied he coolly.\n",
      "\"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly\n",
      "ever does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! you are not serious now.  I know Mr. John Knightley too well--\n",
      "I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as\n",
      "any body.  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you,\n",
      "much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than\n",
      "myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.\n",
      "You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,\n",
      "never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,\n",
      "a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,\n",
      "in worse weather than to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,\"\n",
      "said John Knightley, \"I meant to imply the change of situation\n",
      "which time usually brings.  I consider one as including the other.\n",
      "Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within\n",
      "the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.\n",
      "As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten\n",
      "years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.  A pleasant\n",
      "\"thank you\" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,\n",
      "a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.\n",
      "Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,\n",
      "according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of\n",
      "his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,\n",
      "was ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this\n",
      "morning in the rain.  Young ladies should take care of themselves.--\n",
      "Young ladies are delicate plants.  They should take care of their\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--\n",
      "I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.  They are some\n",
      "of my very old friends.  I wish my health allowed me to be a\n",
      "better neighbour.  You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.\n",
      "My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,\n",
      "and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel\n",
      "that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office\n",
      "in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,\n",
      "how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there\n",
      "to take care of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! do not tell _me_.  You really are a very sad girl, and do not\n",
      "know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?  You and I must positively\n",
      "exert our authority.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My advice,\" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \"I certainly\n",
      "do feel tempted to give.  Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--\n",
      "Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought\n",
      "to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.\n",
      "The spring I always think requires more than common care.\n",
      "Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,\n",
      "than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.  Now do not you\n",
      "feel that you had?  Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.\n",
      "You look as if you would not do such a thing again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\" eagerly rejoined\n",
      "Mrs. Elton.  \"We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\"--\n",
      "and nodding significantly--\"there must be some arrangement made,\n",
      "there must indeed.  I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches\n",
      "our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)\n",
      "shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.  That will obviate\n",
      "all difficulties you know; and from _us_ I really think, my dear Jane,\n",
      "you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are extremely kind,\" said Jane; \"but I cannot give up my\n",
      "early walk.  I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,\n",
      "I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon\n",
      "my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Jane, say no more about it.  The thing is determined,\n",
      "that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine\n",
      "any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.  You know,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.\n",
      "But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely\n",
      "worn out.  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,\n",
      "consider that point as settled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Jane earnestly, \"I cannot by any means consent\n",
      "to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.\n",
      "If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it\n",
      "always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness\n",
      "to employ our men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead\n",
      "of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!\" said she.--\n",
      "\"The regularity and despatch of it!  If one thinks of all that it\n",
      "has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is certainly very well regulated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!  So seldom\n",
      "that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing\n",
      "about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,\n",
      "I suppose, actually lost!  And when one considers the variety\n",
      "of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,\n",
      "it increases the wonder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some\n",
      "quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.  If you\n",
      "want any farther explanation,\" continued he, smiling, \"they are\n",
      "paid for it.  That is the key to a great deal of capacity.\n",
      "The public pays and must be served well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\n",
      "observations made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have heard it asserted,\" said John Knightley, \"that the same\n",
      "sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the\n",
      "same master teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason,\n",
      "I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,\n",
      "for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble\n",
      "into any hand they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write\n",
      "very much alike.  I have not always known their writing apart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said his brother hesitatingly, \"there is a likeness.\n",
      "I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,\" said Mr. Woodhouse;\n",
      "\"and always did.  And so does poor Mrs. Weston\"--with half a sigh\n",
      "and half a smile at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting\"--Emma began, looking also\n",
      "at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "attending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,\n",
      "\"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking\n",
      "his name at once before all these people?  Is it necessary\n",
      "for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--\n",
      "your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,\n",
      "if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the\n",
      "smallest distress.  I certainly get better and better.--Now for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\"Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not admire it,\" said Mr. Knightley.  \"It is too small--\n",
      "wants strength.  It is like a woman's writing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him\n",
      "against the base aspersion.  \"No, it by no means wanted strength--\n",
      "it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.\n",
      "Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?\"  No, she had\n",
      "heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put\n",
      "it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we were in the other room,\" said Emma, \"if I had my writing-desk,\n",
      "I am sure I could produce a specimen.  I have a note of his.--\n",
      "Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you\n",
      "one day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He chose to say he was employed\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner\n",
      "to convince Mr. Knightley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\"\n",
      "said Mr. Knightley dryly, \"writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "he will, of course, put forth his best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,\n",
      "was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request\n",
      "to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\n",

      "\n",
      "Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\n",
      "She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know\n",
      "whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.  She suspected\n",
      "that it _had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered\n",
      "but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,\n",
      "and that it had not been in vain.  She thought there was an air\n",
      "of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition\n",
      "and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--\n",
      "but she abstained.  She was quite determined not to utter a word\n",
      "that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed\n",
      "the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance\n",
      "of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.\n",

      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\n",
      "it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--\n",
      "with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton\n",
      "engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.  She and Mrs. Weston were\n",
      "obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton left them no choice.  If Jane repressed her for a\n",
      "little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed\n",
      "between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,\n",
      "there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:\n",
      "The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,\n",
      "were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must\n",
      "be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had\n",
      "yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of\n",
      "Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\"\n",

      "who can have thought of it as I have done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.  You do not\n",
      "know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations.\n",
      "I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.\n",
      "A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity\n",
      "of applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,\n",
      "for she moves in the first circle.  Wax-candles in the schoolroom!\n",
      "You may imagine how desirable!  Of all houses in the kingdom\n",

      "at present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.  You are afraid of giving\n",
      "me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can\n",
      "hardly be more interested about you than I am.  I shall write\n",
      "to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict\n",
      "charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject\n",
      "to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving\n",
      "any body trouble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,\n",
      "and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business\n",
      "to accomplish before us.  Your inexperience really amuses me!\n",
      "A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you,\n",
      "is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice;\n",
      "indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\n",
      "inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.\n",
      "When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid\n",
      "of being long unemployed.  There are places in town, offices,\n",
      "where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--\n",
      "not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear, human flesh!  You quite shock me; if you mean a fling\n",
      "at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather\n",
      "a friend to the abolition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\" replied Jane;\n",
      "\"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;\n",
      "widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;\n",
      "but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where\n",
      "it lies.  But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,\n",
      "and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon\n",
      "meeting with something that would do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something that would do!\" repeated Mrs. Elton.  \"Aye, _that_ may\n",
      "suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature\n",
      "you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up\n",
      "with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,\n",
      "in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command\n",
      "the elegancies of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\n",
      "it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,\n",
      "I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\n",
      "A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I\n",
      "shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will\n",
      "be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right\n",
      "to move in the first circle.  Your musical knowledge alone would\n",
      "entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,\n",
      "and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--\n",
      "if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;\n",
      "but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,\n",
      "even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must\n",
      "and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before\n",
      "the Campbells or I have any rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort\n",
      "of such a situation together,\" said Jane, \"they are pretty sure\n",
      "to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing\n",
      "to be attempted at present for me.  I am exceedingly obliged to you,\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am\n",
      "quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.\n",
      "For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as\n",
      "I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am quite serious too, I assure you,\" replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\n",
      "\"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends\n",
      "to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing\n",
      "till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change\n",
      "of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\n",
      "gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\n",
      "he is;--I assure you I like him excessively.  I admire all that quaint,\n",
      "old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\n",
      "modern ease often disgusts me.  But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,\n",
      "I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.  Oh!  I assure\n",
      "you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.\n",
      "I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.\n",
      "How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I\n",
      "do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest\n",
      "dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.\n",
      "I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me.\n",
      "A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste\n",
      "is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely\n",
      "preferable to finery.  But I am quite in the minority, I believe;\n",
      "few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery\n",
      "are every thing.  I have some notion of putting such a trimming\n",
      "as this to my white and silver poplin.  Do you think it will\n",
      "look well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room\n",
      "when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.  He had returned\n",
      "to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.\n",
      "He had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--\n",
      "but there was great joy.  Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see\n",
      "him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.  John Knightley\n",
      "only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent\n",
      "his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,\n",
      "should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house,\n",
      "for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing\n",
      "his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,\n",
      "was a circumstance to strike him deeply.  A man who had been in motion\n",
      "since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,\n",
      "who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been\n",
      "in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,\n",
      "to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,\n",
      "and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into\n",
      "the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\n",
      "back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\n",
      "probably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley\n",
      "looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,\n",
      "\"I could not have believed it even of _him_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation\n",
      "he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all\n",
      "the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere\n",
      "from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;\n",
      "and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,\n",
      "convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants\n",
      "had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,\n",
      "was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally\n",
      "addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being\n",
      "highly interesting to every body in the room.  He gave her a letter,\n",
      "it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,\n",
      "and had taken the liberty of opening it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Read it, read it,\" said he, \"it will give you pleasure;\n",
      "only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling\n",
      "and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,\n",
      "but very audible to every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.  Well, what do\n",
      "you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,\n",
      "did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would\n",
      "not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;\n",
      "for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is\n",
      "to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.\n",
      "As to her illness, all nothing of course.  But it is an excellent\n",

      "Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak\n",
      "so fluently.  _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,\n",
      "and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she\n",
      "rather thought was considerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\n",
      "to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\n",
      "and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\n",
      "communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he\n",
      "might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley\n",
      "particularly delighted.  They were the first entitled,\n",
      "after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would\n",
      "have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation\n",
      "with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive\n",
      "an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and\n",
      "her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.\n",

      "Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\n",
      "her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\n",
      "He is to be in town next week, if not sooner.  We have notice of it\n",
      "in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,\n",
      "and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed\n",
      "to me--it was to Mrs. Weston.  She is his principal correspondent,\n",
      "I assure you.  I hardly ever get a letter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!  Oh!  Mr. Weston--\n",
      "(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous\n",
      "precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow\n",
      "your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,\n",
      "we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!  Mr. Weston,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Aye, we men are sad fellows.  You must take care of yourself,\n",
      "Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in\n",
      "a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all\n",
      "coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has\n",
      "not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--\n",
      "so they are all to move southward without loss of time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.  Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London.\n",
      "a considerable journey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.  Sixty-five miles farther\n",
      "than from Maple Grove to London.  But what is distance, Mr. Weston,\n",
      "to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,\n",
      "Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.  You will hardly believe me--\n",
      "but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again\n",
      "with four horses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,\" said Mr. Weston, \"is, that\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\n",
      "sofa for a week together.  In Frank's last letter she complained,\n",
      "he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\n",
      "both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree\n",
      "of weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she\n",
      "means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.\n",
      "Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,\n",
      "Mrs. Elton.  You must grant me that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.  I Always take the part\n",
      "of my own sex.  I do indeed.  I give you notice--You will find me\n",
      "a formidable antagonist on that point.  I always stand up for women--\n",
      "and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect\n",
      "to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's\n",
      "making incredible exertions to avoid it.  Selina says it is quite\n",
      "horror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety.\n",
      "She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.\n",
      "Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other\n",
      "fine lady ever did.  Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady\n",
      "in the land for\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.  Selina is no fine lady,\n",
      "I assure you.  Do not run away with such an idea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not she?  Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is\n",
      "as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\n",
      "It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister\n",
      "was _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence\n",
      "of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,\n",
      "when Mr. Weston went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--\n",
      "but this is quite between ourselves.  She is very fond of Frank,\n",
      "and therefore I would not speak ill of her.  Besides, she is out of\n",
      "health now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been.\n",
      "I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much\n",
      "faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,\n",
      "or to Clifton?\"  \"She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too\n",
      "cold for her.  The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.\n",
      "She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever\n",
      "was before, and she begins to want change.  It is a retired place.\n",
      "A fine place, but very retired.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.  Nothing can stand more retired from\n",
      "the road than Maple Grove.  Such an immense plantation all round it!\n",
      "You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--\n",
      "And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina\n",
      "to enjoy that sort of seclusion.  Or, perhaps she may not have\n",
      "resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.\n",
      "I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel\n",
      "very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent\n",
      "of society.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Frank was here in February for a fortnight.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume\n",
      "to call myself an addition.  But perhaps he may never have heard\n",
      "of there being such a creature in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,\n",
      "and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear madam!  Nobody but yourself could imagine such a\n",
      "thing possible.  Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's\n",
      "letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had done his duty and could return to his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When Frank left us,\" continued he, \"it was quite uncertain when we\n",
      "might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome.\n",
      "It has been completely unexpected.  That is, _I_ always had a strong\n",
      "persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something\n",
      "favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.  He and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "were both dreadfully desponding.  `How could he contrive to come?\n",
      "And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare\n",
      "him again?' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen\n",
      "in our favour; and so it has, you see.  I have observed, Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,\n",
      "they are sure to mend the next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.  It is just what I used\n",
      "to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,\n",
      "when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all\n",
      "the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,\n",
      "and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before\n",
      "Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have\n",
      "been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!\n",
      "The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,\n",
      "I remember, he came to me quite in despair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\n",
      "seized the opportunity of going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were mentioning May.  May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\n",
      "is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place\n",
      "than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the\n",
      "agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--\n",
      "precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen\n",
      "for it:  days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,\n",
      "always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.  When he\n",
      "was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal\n",
      "of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,\n",
      "and we could not do half that we intended.  Now will be the time.\n",
      "This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant\n",
      "expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,\n",
      "and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having\n",
      "him actually in the house.  I think it is so.  I think it is the\n",
      "state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you\n",
      "will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.\n",
      "He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,\n",
      "most gratifying to me.  She thinks nobody equal to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my\n",
      "opinion will be decidedly in his favour.  I have heard so much\n",
      "in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair\n",
      "to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,\n",
      "and are by no means implicitly guided by others.  I give you notice\n",
      "that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston was musing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope,\" said he presently, \"I have not been severe upon poor\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;\n",
      "but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult\n",
      "for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.\n",
      "You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,\n",
      "nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,\n",
      "the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator.\n",
      "Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her.\n",
      "Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's:\n",
      "his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would\n",
      "harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;\n",
      "but her pride is arrogance and insolence!  And what inclines one less\n",
      "to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody\n",
      "when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever\n",
      "since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them\n",
      "all in high and mighty claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is\n",
      "an upstart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite\n",
      "a horror of upstarts.  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust\n",
      "to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood\n",
      "who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs\n",
      "they give themselves!  Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me\n",
      "think of them directly.  People of the name of Tupman, very lately\n",
      "settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving\n",
      "themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old\n",
      "established families.  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can\n",
      "have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.\n",
      "They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,\n",
      "you know, Mr. Weston.  One has not great hopes from Birmingham.\n",
      "I always say there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing\n",
      "more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things\n",
      "I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently\n",
      "think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens\n",
      "to be one of their nearest neighbours.  It is infinitely too bad.\n",
      "Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,\n",
      "and whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am\n",
      "almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before\n",
      "his death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were interrupted.  Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,\n",
      "having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of\n",
      "walking away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "to cards.  The remaining five were left to their own powers,\n",
      "and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\n",
      "little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,\n",
      "which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself\n",
      "in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.\n",
      "He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about\n",
      "the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is\n",
      "down at full length there we may be sure.  My charge would be much\n",
      "more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit;\n",
      "all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,\n",
      "and do not physic them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I rather hope to satisfy you both,\" said Emma, \"for I shall do all\n",
      "in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;\n",
      "and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is very likely.  You think so, do not you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--\n",
      "or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements\n",
      "continue to increase as much as they have done lately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Increase!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made\n",
      "a great difference in your way of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Difference!  No indeed I am not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\n",
      "than you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come\n",
      "down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--\n",
      "When did it happen before, or any thing like it?  Your neighbourhood\n",
      "is increasing, and you mix more with it.  A little while ago,\n",
      "every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;\n",
      "dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.  The difference\n",
      "which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said his brother quickly, \"it is Randalls that does it all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\n",
      "influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\n",
      "that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.  And if they are,\n",
      "I only beg you to send them home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" cried Mr. Knightley, \"that need not be the consequence.\n",
      "Let them be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Emma, \"you amuse me!  I should like to know\n",
      "how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\n",
      "of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\n",
      "to attend to the little boys.  These amazing engagements of mine--\n",
      "what have they been?  Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball\n",
      "talked of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at\n",
      "Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of\n",
      "your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.\n",
      "But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom\n",
      "I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a\n",
      "series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear\n",
      "little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,\n",
      "I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,\n",
      "who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--\n",
      "and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling\n",
      "his accounts.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\n",
      "nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.\n",
      "She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at\n",
      "all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.  Her own attachment\n",
      "had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--\n",
      "but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love\n",
      "of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment\n",
      "which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.  If a separation\n",
      "of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils\n",
      "before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.\n",
      "She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,\n",
      "and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\n",
      "That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!\n",
      "and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.\n",
      "She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,\n",
      "an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\n",
      "before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's\n",
      "feelings.  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had\n",
      "been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.  He rode\n",
      "down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came\n",
      "from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all\n",
      "her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,\n",
      "and how she must act.  They met with the utmost friendliness.\n",
      "There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her.\n",
      "But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\n",
      "had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.\n",
      "She watched him well.  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he\n",
      "had been.  Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,\n",
      "had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\n",
      "delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories:\n",
      "and he was not without agitation.  It was not in his calmness that\n",
      "she read his comparative difference.  He was not calm; his spirits\n",
      "were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.\n",
      "Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;\n",
      "but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a\n",
      "quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.\n",
      "\"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--\n",
      "he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he\n",
      "had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,\n",
      "and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\"\n",
      "She had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his\n",
      "agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;\n",
      "and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her\n",
      "returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself\n",
      "with her long.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\n",
      "He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.\n",
      "His aunt could not bear to have him leave her.  Such was his own account\n",
      "at Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,\n",
      "it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had\n",
      "been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.\n",
      "That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself\n",
      "convinced of it, at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could\n",
      "not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state\n",
      "of health than she had been half a year ago.  He did not believe it\n",
      "to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,\n",
      "or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;\n",
      "but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say\n",
      "that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong\n",
      "as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could\n",
      "not endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation\n",
      "and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to\n",
      "Randalls communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove\n",
      "immediately to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended\n",
      "to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise\n",
      "a fancy for the place.  A ready-furnished house in a favourite\n",
      "spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\n",
      "and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two\n",
      "months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--\n",
      "for the house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now\n",
      "he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,\n",
      "almost as often as he could even wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.  He was\n",
      "considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.\n",
      "She hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable.  He was quite delighted.\n",
      "It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.  Now, it would\n",
      "be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles\n",
      "to a young man?--An hour's ride.  He would be always coming over.\n",
      "The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough\n",
      "to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing\n",
      "him never.  Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen\n",
      "to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.  Were he ever able\n",
      "to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.\n",
      "There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be\n",
      "at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.\n",
      "Better than nearer!\n",
      "\n",
      "One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--\n",
      "the ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before, but it had\n",
      "been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.  Now, however,\n",
      "it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon\n",
      "after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,\n",
      "to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,\n",
      "and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four\n",
      "hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.  A very few to-morrows\n",
      "stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse was resigned.  The time of year lightened the evil\n",
      "to him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates\n",
      "was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,\n",
      "and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear\n",
      "little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear\n",
      "Emma were gone.\n",

      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.  The day approached,\n",
      "the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,\n",
      "Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\n",
      "before dinner, and every thing was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.\n",
      "The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better\n",
      "than a common meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very\n",
      "earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible\n",
      "after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the\n",
      "propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,\n",
      "that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet\n",
      "interval in the young man's company.  She was to convey Harriet,\n",
      "and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just\n",
      "sufficiently before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though\n",
      "he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have\n",
      "a delightful evening.  They all walked about together, to see\n",
      "that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes\n",
      "were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma\n",
      "could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.\n",
      "\"So unreasonably early!\" she was going to exclaim; but she presently\n",
      "found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,\n",
      "by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were\n",
      "so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been\n",
      "entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,\n",
      "on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might\n",
      "soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which\n",
      "Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and\n",
      "intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,\n",
      "was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.\n",
      "She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness\n",
      "would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,\n",
      "but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--\n",
      "She could fancy such a man.  The whole party walked about,\n",
      "and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,\n",
      "formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\n",
      "various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_,\n",
      "a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number\n",
      "of privy councillors was not yet larger.  They had stopped\n",
      "at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage,\n",
      "but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\n",
      "which shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going\n",
      "to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--\n",
      "impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was spoken of.  \"I think she must be here soon,\" said he.\n",
      "\"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much\n",
      "of her.  It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A carriage was heard.  He was on the move immediately;\n",
      "but coming back, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.  I have never seen\n",
      "either Mr. or Mrs. Elton.  I have no business to put myself forward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\" said Mr. Weston, looking about.\n",
      "\"We thought you were to bring them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mistake had been slight.  The carriage was sent for them now.\n",
      "Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton\n",
      "might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,\n",
      "and her smiles of graciousness.  He was immediately qualifying\n",
      "himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,\n",
      "after the introduction had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\n",
      "\"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father:\n",
      "\"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\"  and away he went.  Mr. Weston\n",
      "was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her\n",
      "opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young\n",
      "man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out\n",
      "of hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told\n",
      "you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am\n",
      "extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.  I never compliment.\n",
      "I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely\n",
      "what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least\n",
      "conceit or puppyism.  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--\n",
      "quite a horror of them.  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.\n",
      "Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we\n",
      "used sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost\n",
      "to a fault, bore with them much better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;\n",
      "but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were\n",
      "ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must\n",
      "hurry away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.  \"I have no doubt of its being\n",
      "our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.  Our coachman and horses are\n",
      "so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--\n",
      "What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--\n",
      "I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it\n",
      "will be quite unnecessary.  You may be very sure I shall always\n",
      "take care of _them_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,\n",
      "walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much\n",
      "her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them.  Her gestures and\n",
      "movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;\n",
      "but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the\n",
      "incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not\n",
      "finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted\n",
      "into the circle at the fire.  As the door opened she was heard,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.  Nothing to signify.\n",
      "I do not care for myself.  Quite thick shoes.  And Jane declares--\n",
      "Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!  This is brilliant\n",
      "indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.\n",
      "Nothing wanting.  Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--\n",
      "Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?  Oh!  Mr. Weston,\n",
      "you must really have had Aladdin's lamp.  Good Mrs. Stokes\n",
      "would not know her own room again.  I saw her as I came in;\n",
      "she was standing in the entrance.  `Oh!  Mrs. Stokes,' said I--\n",
      "but I had not time for more.\"  She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--\n",
      "\"Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.\n",
      "Very happy to hear it.  So afraid you might have a headache!--\n",
      "seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.\n",
      "Delighted to hear it indeed.  Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged\n",
      "to you for the carriage!--excellent time.  Jane and I quite ready.\n",
      "Did not keep the horses a moment.  Most comfortable carriage.--\n",
      "Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.\n",
      "Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--\n",
      "But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.\n",
      "I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am--.'  Thank you, my mother\n",
      "is remarkably well.  Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take\n",
      "her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\n",
      "Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\n",
      "Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice.  There were\n",
      "three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.\n",
      "Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.  My dear Jane,\n",
      "are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,\n",
      "but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--\n",
      "and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his\n",
      "extreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you\n",
      "my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet\n",
      "never came out again.  My mother often talks of your good-nature.\n",
      "Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--\n",
      "Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--\n",
      "Very well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--\n",
      "Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma\n",
      "most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--\n",
      "She did it all herself.  Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--\n",
      "No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--\n",
      "and Mrs. Hughes.  Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for\n",
      "a moment.--How do you do?  How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.\n",
      "This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--\n",
      "Oh! there he is.  Don't disturb him.  Much better employed talking\n",
      "to the young ladies.  How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the\n",
      "other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--\n",
      "and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host\n",
      "of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do\n",
      "you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.  Never better.--\n",
      "Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the\n",
      "worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about\n",
      "among such friends!  And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.\n",
      "No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea\n",
      "if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\n",
      "Every thing so good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\n",
      "Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\n",
      "discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little\n",
      "way behind her.--He was thoughtful.  Whether he were overhearing too,\n",
      "she could not determine.  After a good many compliments to Jane\n",
      "on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--\n",
      "and it was, \"How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--\n",
      "How has Wright done my hair?\"--with many other relative questions,\n",
      "all answered with patient politeness.  Mrs. Elton then said,\n",
      "\"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such\n",
      "an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,\n",
      "and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving\n",
      "this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior\n",
      "to others.  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--\n",
      "So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see\n",
      "if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\n",
      "I like him very well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could\n",
      "not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want\n",
      "to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,\n",
      "till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly\n",
      "forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--\n",
      "I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be\n",
      "impatient for tidings of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jane!\"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--\n",
      "\"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you like Mrs. Elton?\" said Emma in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are ungrateful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?\"  Then changing from a frown to\n",
      "a smile--\"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--\n",
      "Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.\n",
      "He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity,\n",
      "which must be laid before Emma.  It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston\n",
      "that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would\n",
      "expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma\n",
      "that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\" said Mr. Weston.\n",
      "\"She will think Frank ought to ask her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;\n",
      "and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\n",
      "perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\n",
      "wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\n",
      "was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--\n",
      "Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.\n",
      "It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had\n",
      "undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;\n",
      "for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could\n",
      "not lose by the change.  Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.--\n",
      "In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,\n",
      "delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,\n",
      "and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--\n",
      "She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any\n",
      "thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not\n",
      "to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,\n",
      "and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest\n",
      "in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--\n",
      "He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,\n",
      "than where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright figure,\n",
      "among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,\n",
      "was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her\n",
      "own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men\n",
      "who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\n",
      "and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike\n",
      "a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he\n",
      "but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him\n",
      "to smile; but in general he was looking grave.  She wished he could\n",
      "love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--\n",
      "He seemed often observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he\n",
      "thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,\n",
      "she did not feel afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between\n",
      "her and her partner.  They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,\n",
      "than lovers.  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done,\n",
      "was indubitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant\n",
      "attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body\n",
      "seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,\n",
      "which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,\n",
      "was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.\n",
      "Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive\n",
      "than such meetings usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma\n",
      "thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,\n",
      "and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--\n",
      "and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there\n",
      "could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder\n",
      "lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.\n",
      "He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:\n",
      "she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to\n",
      "escape into the card-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Escape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room\n",
      "where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about\n",
      "in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution\n",
      "of maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly\n",
      "before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--\n",
      "Emma saw it.  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way\n",
      "up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,\n",
      "and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.  When she was\n",
      "half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she\n",
      "would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,\n",
      "that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took\n",
      "place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,\n",
      "who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,\n",
      "but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,\n",
      "gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, \"Do not\n",
      "you dance, Mr. Elton?\" to which his prompt reply was, \"Most readily,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.\n",
      "I am no dancer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\" said he, \"I shall have great pleasure,\n",
      "I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man,\n",
      "and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great\n",
      "pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\n",
      "disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\"\n",
      "\"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--\n",
      "and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston.  You will excuse me.  Any thing else I should be most happy\n",
      "to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what\n",
      "surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat.\n",
      "This was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--\n",
      "She looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a\n",
      "little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,\n",
      "while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not look again.  Her heart was in a glow, and she feared\n",
      "her face might be as hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley\n",
      "leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,\n",
      "seldom more delighted, than at that instant.  She was all pleasure\n",
      "and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be\n",
      "thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance\n",
      "said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.\n",
      "\n",
      "His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,\n",
      "extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,\n",
      "if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for\n",
      "the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction\n",
      "which her happy features announced.  It was not thrown away on her,\n",
      "she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,\n",
      "and was in a continual course of smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)\n",
      "very foolish.  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,\n",
      "though growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings,\n",
      "by observing audibly to her partner,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,\n",
      "I declare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Supper was announced.  The move began; and Miss Bates might be\n",
      "heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being\n",
      "seated at table and taking up her spoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid\n",
      "there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has\n",
      "been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,\n",
      "indeed you must.  Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!\n",
      "How well you put it on!--so gratified!  Excellent dancing indeed!--\n",
      "Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama\n",
      "to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without\n",
      "saying a word, just as I told you.  Grandmama was quite well,\n",
      "had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,\n",
      "and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples\n",
      "and wine before she came away:  amazing luck in some of her throws:\n",
      "and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,\n",
      "and who were your partners.  `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane;\n",
      "I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you\n",
      "all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\n",
      "I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'\n",
      "My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would\n",
      "not rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,\n",
      "Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand\n",
      "a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant\n",
      "she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.\n",
      "Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.\n",
      "Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is\n",
      "but one.  Well, I was persuaded there were two.  How very odd!\n",
      "I was convinced there were two, and there is but one.  I never saw any\n",
      "thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\n",
      "you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--\n",
      "The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;\n",
      "but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus\n",
      "brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the\n",
      "asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.  Now there\n",
      "is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--\n",
      "so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it\n",
      "to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!\n",
      "I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such\n",
      "elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--\n",
      "Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?  Anywhere, so that\n",
      "Jane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\n",
      "Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--\n",
      "only it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you direct\n",
      "in this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever\n",
      "recollect half the dishes for grandmama?  Soup too!  Bless me!\n",
      "I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I\n",
      "cannot help beginning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till\n",
      "after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,\n",
      "her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.\n",
      "He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been\n",
      "unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due\n",
      "share of censure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\" said he.  \"Emma, why\n",
      "is it that they are your enemies?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving\n",
      "no answer, added, \"_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,\n",
      "whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;\n",
      "but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did,\" replied Emma, \"and they cannot forgive me.\"\n",

      "He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever\n",
      "tell me I am wrong?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads\n",
      "you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.\n",
      "There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I\n",
      "did not:  and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.\n",
      "It was through a series of strange blunders!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice\n",
      "to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for\n",
      "himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton\n",
      "is totally without.  An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--\n",
      "infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such\n",
      "a woman as Mrs. Elton.  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle\n",
      "of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--\n",
      "Come Emma, set your companions the example.  Every body is lazy!\n",
      "Every body is asleep!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am ready,\" said Emma, \"whenever I am wanted.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I will.  You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we\n",

      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\n",
      "pleasure.  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,\n",
      "which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was\n",
      "extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting\n",
      "the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so\n",
      "much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,\n",
      "was peculiarly gratifying.  The impertinence of the Eltons, which for\n",
      "a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been\n",
      "the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked\n",
      "forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--\n",
      "From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they\n",
      "quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes\n",
      "were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton\n",
      "was not the superior creature she had believed him.  The fever\n",
      "was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being\n",
      "quickened again by injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil\n",
      "feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed\n",
      "neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,\n",
      "Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not\n",
      "wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told\n",
      "her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping\n",
      "at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.\n",
      "She did not regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\n",
      "to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\n",
      "for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\n",
      "when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered\n",
      "whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,\n",
      "with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment\n",
      "sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\n",
      "Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--\n",
      "The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--\n",
      "they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking\n",
      "into a chair fainted away.\n",
      "\n",
      "A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\n",
      "and surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting,\n",
      "but the suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma\n",
      "acquainted with the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at\n",
      "Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,\n",
      "and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public\n",
      "enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile\n",
      "beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms\n",
      "on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;\n",
      "and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,\n",
      "they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,\n",
      "on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.\n",
      "A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,\n",
      "excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet\n",
      "to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,\n",
      "and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\n",
      "But poor Harriet could not follow.  She had suffered very much\n",
      "from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\n",
      "brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--\n",
      "and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged\n",
      "to remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been\n",
      "more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack\n",
      "could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a\n",
      "dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,\n",
      "and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and\n",
      "more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out\n",
      "her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,\n",
      "or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,\n",
      "and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,\n",
      "and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,\n",
      "demanding more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling\n",
      "and conditioning, they loud and insolent.  By a most fortunate\n",
      "chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him\n",
      "to her assistance at this critical moment.  The pleasantness\n",
      "of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his\n",
      "horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--\n",
      "and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before\n",
      "of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had\n",
      "been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:\n",
      "he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,\n",
      "was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.\n",
      "The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet\n",
      "was then their own portion.  He had left them completely frightened;\n",
      "and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,\n",
      "had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits\n",
      "were quite overcome.  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:\n",
      "he had thought of no other place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and\n",
      "of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--\n",
      "He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays\n",
      "left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give\n",
      "assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there\n",
      "being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter\n",
      "for her friend and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young\n",
      "woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting\n",
      "certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.\n",
      "So Emma thought, at least.  Could a linguist, could a grammarian,\n",
      "could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their\n",
      "appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling\n",
      "that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting\n",
      "to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,\n",
      "be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such\n",
      "a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very extraordinary thing!  Nothing of the sort had ever\n",
      "occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;\n",
      "no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened\n",
      "to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very\n",
      "person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly\n",
      "was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable\n",
      "state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.\n",
      "He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,\n",
      "she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.  It seemed as if\n",
      "every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.\n",
      "It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly\n",
      "recommending each to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him,\n",
      "while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\n",
      "her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\n",
      "sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's\n",
      "own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation\n",
      "at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.\n",
      "Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled\n",
      "nor assisted.  She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.\n",
      "No, she had had enough of interference.  There could be no harm\n",
      "in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.  It was no more than a wish.\n",
      "Beyond it she would on no account proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge\n",
      "of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion:\n",
      "but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.  Within half\n",
      "an hour it was known all over Highbury.  It was the very event\n",
      "to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all\n",
      "the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of\n",
      "frightful news.  The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies.\n",
      "Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,\n",
      "would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go\n",
      "beyond the shrubbery again.  It was some comfort to him that many\n",

      "A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came\n",
      "one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after\n",
      "sitting down and hesitating, thus began:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I\n",
      "should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,\n",
      "you know, it will be over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.\n",
      "There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her,\n",
      "quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\" she continued,\n",
      "\"to have no reserves with you on this subject.  As I am happily\n",
      "quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you\n",
      "should have the satisfaction of knowing it.  I do not want to say\n",
      "more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way\n",
      "as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Emma, \"I hope I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . .\"\n",
      "cried Harriet, warmly.  \"It seems like madness!  I can see nothing\n",
      "at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet\n",
      "him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--\n",
      "and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do\n",
      "not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,\n",
      "as I have done:  she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,\n",
      "but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget\n",
      "her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\n",
      "it will not give me another moment's pang:  and to convince you\n",
      "that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I\n",
      "ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--\n",
      "I know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I\n",
      "will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it\n",
      "in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.\n",
      "Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?\" said she, with a conscious look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have\n",
      "valued very much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\n",
      "_precious_ _treasures_ on the top.  Her curiosity was greatly excited.\n",
      "Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.\n",
      "Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\n",
      "which Harriet opened:  it was well lined with the softest cotton;\n",
      "but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Harriet, \"you _must_ recollect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed I do not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me!  I should not have thought it possible you could forget\n",
      "what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very\n",
      "last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I\n",
      "had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--\n",
      "I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger\n",
      "with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--\n",
      "But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired\n",
      "me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;\n",
      "but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept\n",
      "playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.\n",
      "And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--\n",
      "so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then\n",
      "as a great treat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dearest Harriet!\" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\n",
      "and jumping up, \"you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\n",
      "Remember it?  Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving\n",
      "this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting\n",
      "the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\n",
      "about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in\n",
      "my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a\n",
      "continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--\n",
      "go on--what else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And had you really some at hand yourself?  I am sure I never\n",
      "suspected it, you did it so naturally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\"\n",
      "said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\n",
      "between wonder and amusement.  And secretly she added to herself,\n",
      "\"Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton\n",
      "a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!\n",
      "I never was equal to this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here,\" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \"here is\n",
      "something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable,\n",
      "because this is what did really once belong to him, which the\n",
      "court-plaister never did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.  It was the end\n",
      "of an old pencil,--the part without any lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was really his,\" said Harriet.--\"Do not you remember\n",
      "one morning?--no, I dare say you do not.  But one morning--I forget\n",
      "exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before\n",
      "_that_ _evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;\n",
      "it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him\n",
      "something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;\n",
      "but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he\n",
      "soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,\n",
      "and this was left upon the table as good for nothing.  But I kept\n",
      "my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never\n",
      "parted with it again from that moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do remember it,\" cried Emma; \"I perfectly remember it.--\n",
      "Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\n",
      "liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too.\n",
      "I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,\n",
      "was not he?  I have an idea he was standing just here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  I do not know.  I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,\n",
      "but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,\n",
      "much about where I am now.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! that's all.  I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--\n",
      "except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,\n",
      "and I wish you to see me do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness\n",
      "in treasuring up these things?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish\n",
      "I could forget as easily as I can burn them.  It was very wrong\n",
      "of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.\n",
      "I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have\n",
      "not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister\n",
      "might be useful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be happier to burn it,\" replied Harriet.  \"It has\n",
      "a disagreeable look to me.  I must get rid of every thing.--\n",
      "There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when,\" thought Emma, \"will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\n",
      "already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\n",
      "_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a\n",
      "fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,\n",
      "and quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,\n",
      "which made the information she received more valuable.\n",
      "She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, \"Well, Harriet,\n",
      "whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so\"--and thought\n",
      "no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet\n",
      "say in a very serious tone, \"I shall never marry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\n",
      "moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never marry!--This is a new resolution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is one that I shall never change, however.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After another short hesitation, \"I hope it does not proceed from--\n",
      "I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Elton indeed!\" cried Harriet indignantly.--\"Oh! no\"--and Emma\n",
      "could just catch the words, \"so superior to Mr. Elton!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took a longer time for consideration.  Should she proceed\n",
      "no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--\n",
      "Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;\n",
      "or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive\n",
      "Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing\n",
      "like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent\n",
      "discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--\n",
      "She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,\n",
      "all that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing was always best.\n",
      "She had previously determined how far she would proceed,\n",
      "on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,\n",
      "to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--\n",
      "She was decided, and thus spoke--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.\n",
      "Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,\n",
      "results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,\n",
      "would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.\n",
      "Is not it so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\n",
      "Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him\n",
      "at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all\n",
      "the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,\n",
      "which are so proper, in me especially.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.  The service he rendered\n",
      "you was enough to warm your heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--\n",
      "The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--\n",
      "when I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.\n",
      "Such a change!  In one moment such a change!  From perfect misery\n",
      "to perfect happiness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very natural.  It is natural, and it is honourable.--\n",
      "Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--\n",
      "But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.\n",
      "I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.  I do not by any\n",
      "means engage for its being returned.  Consider what you are about.\n",
      "Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can:\n",
      "at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded\n",
      "of his liking you.  Be observant of him.  Let his behaviour be the\n",
      "guide of your sensations.  I give you this caution now, because I\n",
      "shall never speak to you again on the subject.  I am determined\n",
      "against all interference.  Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.\n",
      "Let no name ever pass our lips.  We were very wrong before;\n",
      "we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there\n",
      "do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;\n",
      "but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have\n",
      "been matches of greater disparity.  But take care of yourself.\n",
      "I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,\n",
      "be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste\n",
      "which I shall always know how to value.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.\n",
      "Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing\n",
      "for her friend.  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--\n",
      "and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.\n",

      "In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened\n",
      "upon Hartfield.  To Highbury in general it brought no material change.\n",
      "The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,\n",
      "and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax\n",
      "was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells\n",
      "from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,\n",
      "fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,\n",
      "provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity\n",
      "in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful\n",
      "situation against her will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\n",
      "taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\n",
      "him more.  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his\n",
      "pursuit of Emma.  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\n",
      "Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints,\n",
      "his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison;\n",
      "words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.\n",
      "But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him\n",
      "over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination\n",
      "to trifle with Jane Fairfax.  He could not understand it; but there\n",
      "were symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--\n",
      "symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,\n",
      "he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,\n",
      "however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination.\n",
      "_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.  He was dining\n",
      "with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had\n",
      "seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,\n",
      "from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.\n",
      "When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering\n",

      "were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Myself creating what I saw,\"\n",
      "\n",

      "He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,\n",

      "exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.\n",
      "They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it\n",
      "was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,\n",
      "pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.  The Randalls\n",
      "party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech\n",

      "and was extremely happy about it.  It was owing to _her_ persuasion,\n",
      "as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal\n",
      "of harm.  You must remember it now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must\n",

      "you walk as if you were tired.  You will not be sorry to find\n",
      "yourself at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this?--What is this?\" cried Mr. Weston, \"about Perry\n",
      "and a carriage?  Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?\n",
      "I am glad he can afford it.  You had it from himself, had you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir,\" replied his son, laughing, \"I seem to have had it\n",
      "from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's\n",
      "having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,\n",
      "with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard\n",
      "a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.  I am\n",
      "a great dreamer.  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--\n",
      "and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin\n",
      "dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is odd though,\" observed his father, \"that you should have had such\n",
      "a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\n",
      "should be thinking of at Enscombe.  Perry's setting up his carriage!\n",
      "and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--\n",
      "just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;\n",
      "only a little premature.  What an air of probability sometimes\n",
      "runs through a dream!  And at others, what a heap of absurdities\n",
      "it is!  Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in\n",
      "your thoughts when you are absent.  Emma, you are a great dreamer,\n",
      "I think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was out of hearing.  She had hurried on before her guests\n",
      "to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach\n",
      "of Mr. Weston's hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, to own the truth,\" cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\n",
      "to be heard the last two minutes, \"if I must speak on this subject,\n",
      "there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not\n",
      "mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes\n",
      "the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,\n",
      "I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;\n",
      "for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles\n",

      "known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.\n",
      "Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came\n",
      "to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she\n",

      "she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not\n",
      "to go beyond:  and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it\n",
      "to a soul that I know of.  At the same time, I will not positively\n",
      "answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do\n",
      "sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.  I am a talker,\n",
      "you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing\n",

      "where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,\n",
      "he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,\n",
      "and too busy with her shawl.  Mr. Weston had walked in.  The two\n",
      "other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.  Mr. Knightley\n",
      "suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--\n",
      "he seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--\n",
      "Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no time for farther remark or explanation.  The dream must\n",
      "be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\n",
      "the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\n",
      "and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\n",
      "persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,\n",
      "on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Miss Woodhouse,\" said Frank Churchill, after examining a table\n",
      "behind him, which he could reach as he sat, \"have your nephews taken\n",
      "away their alphabets--their box of letters?  It used to stand here.\n",
      "Where is it?  This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought\n",
      "to be treated rather as winter than summer.  We had great amusement\n",
      "with those letters one morning.  I want to puzzle you again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\n",
      "was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\n",
      "disposed to employ as their two selves.  They were rapidly forming\n",
      "words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.\n",
      "The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,\n",
      "which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily\n",
      "occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure\n",
      "of the \"poor little boys,\" or in fondly pointing out, as he took\n",
      "up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.  She gave\n",
      "a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.\n",
      "Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley\n",
      "so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much\n",
      "as he could, with as little apparent observation.  The word\n",
      "was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.  If meant\n",
      "to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,\n",
      "she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,\n",
      "for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,\n",
      "and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.\n",
      "She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\n",
      "The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,\n",
      "there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not\n",
      "otherwise ostensible.  Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;\n",
      "but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.\n",
      "How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been\n",
      "so lain asleep!  He feared there must be some decided involvement.\n",
      "Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.\n",
      "These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.\n",
      "It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\n",
      "Churchill's part.\n",
      "\n",
      "With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great\n",
      "alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions.\n",
      "He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look\n",
      "sly and demure.  He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found\n",
      "it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it\n",
      "proper to appear to censure; for she said, \"Nonsense! for shame!\"\n",
      "He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,\n",
      "\"I will give it to her--shall I?\"--and as clearly heard Emma\n",
      "opposing it with eager laughing warmth.  \"No, no, you must not;\n",
      "you shall not, indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love\n",
      "without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,\n",
      "directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular\n",
      "degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley's\n",
      "excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize\n",
      "every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was\n",
      "not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_.  Jane Fairfax's perception\n",
      "seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal\n",
      "to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters\n",
      "so arranged.  She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing\n",
      "herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,\n",
      "and saying only, \"I did not know that proper names were allowed,\"\n",
      "pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked\n",
      "resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.\n",
      "Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned\n",
      "towards her aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, very true, my dear,\" cried the latter, though Jane had not\n",
      "spoken a word--\"I was just going to say the same thing.  It is time\n",
      "for us to be going indeed.  The evening is closing in, and grandmama\n",
      "will be looking for us.  My dear sir, you are too obliging.\n",
      "We really must wish you good night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt\n",
      "had preconceived.  She was immediately up, and wanting to quit\n",
      "the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;\n",
      "and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously\n",
      "pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.\n",
      "She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was\n",
      "looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;\n",
      "and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full\n",
      "of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist\n",
      "his observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--\n",
      "an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question.\n",
      "He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to\n",
      "preserve her.  It was his duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, Emma,\" said he, \"may I ask in what lay the great amusement,\n",
      "the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?\n",
      "I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very\n",
      "entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was extremely confused.  She could not endure to give him the\n",
      "true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,\n",
      "she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" she cried in evident embarrassment, \"it all meant nothing;\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.  She would\n",
      "rather busy herself about any thing than speak.  He sat a little\n",
      "while in doubt.  A variety of evils crossed his mind.  Interference--\n",
      "fruitless interference.  Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy,\n",
      "seemed to declare her affection engaged.  Yet he would speak.\n",
      "He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in\n",
      "an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter\n",
      "any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Emma,\" said he at last, with earnest kindness, \"do you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,\n",
      "or that she admired him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, never!\" she cried with a most open eagerness--\"Never, for\n",
      "the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.\n",
      "And how could it possibly come into your head?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--\n",
      "very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will\n",
      "not do.  There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;\n",
      "and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some\n",
      "peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--\n",
      "it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of\n",
      "nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,\n",
      "which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or\n",
      "admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.\n",
      "That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I can _answer_ for its\n",
      "being so on his.  I will answer for the gentleman's indifference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\n",
      "which silenced, Mr. Knightley.  She was in gay spirits, and would\n",
      "have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars\n",
      "of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows\n",
      "of a circumstance which highly entertained her:  but his gaiety did\n",
      "not meet hers.  He found he could not be useful, and his feelings\n",
      "were too much irritated for talking.  That he might not be irritated\n",
      "into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender\n",
      "habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon\n",

      "Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\n",
      "of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.\n",
      "No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores\n",
      "at present.  In the daily interchange of news, they must be again\n",
      "restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'\n",
      "coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\n",
      "whose health seemed every day to supply a different report,\n",
      "and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped\n",
      "might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,\n",
      "as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed.  It was the delay of a great\n",
      "deal of pleasure and parade.  Her introductions and recommendations\n",
      "must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.\n",
      "So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced\n",
      "her that every thing need not be put off.  Why should not they\n",
      "explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?  They could\n",
      "go there again with them in the autumn.  It was settled that they\n",
      "should go to Box Hill.  That there was to be such a party had been\n",
      "long generally known:  it had even given the idea of another.\n",
      "Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body\n",
      "found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\n",
      "to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.  Two or three more\n",
      "of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to\n",
      "be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior\n",
      "to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,\n",
      "and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could\n",
      "not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing\n",
      "from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her\n",
      "brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,\n",
      "and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded\n",
      "to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.  Now, as her\n",
      "objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth\n",
      "bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof\n",
      "to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found\n",
      "herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she\n",
      "would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\n",
      "probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of\n",
      "Mrs. Elton's party!  Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance\n",
      "of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am glad you approve of what I have done,\" said he very comfortably.\n",

      "It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\n",
      "was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston\n",
      "as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw\n",
      "every thing into sad uncertainty.  It might be weeks, it might be\n",
      "only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations\n",

      "What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You had better explore to Donwell,\" replied Mr. Knightley.\n",

      "\n",
      "If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\n",
      "for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \"Oh!  I should\n",
      "like it of all things,\" was not plainer in words than manner.\n",
      "Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for\n",
      "the invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have\n",
      "been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.\n",
      "She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than\n",

      "such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.\n",

      "Leave it all to me.  I will invite your guests.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\"--he calmly replied,--\"there is but one married woman in the world\n",

      "and that one is--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage\n",
      "such matters myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! you are an odd creature!\" she cried, satisfied to have no\n",
      "one preferred to herself.--\"You are a humourist, and may say what\n",
      "you like.  Quite a humourist.  Well, I shall bring Jane with me--\n",
      "Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.  I have no objections\n",

      "\"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.\n",
      "It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.\n",
      "I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets\n",
      "hanging on my arm.  Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.\n",
      "Nothing can be more simple, you see.  And Jane will have such another.\n",
      "There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are\n",
      "to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,\n",
      "and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,\n",
      "it is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.\n",
      "Every thing as natural and simple as possible.  Is not that your idea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite.  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\n",
      "the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity\n",
      "of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think\n",
      "is best observed by meals within doors.  When you are tired of eating\n",
      "strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out.  And, by the bye,\n",
      "can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--\n",
      "Pray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,\n",
      "or to inspect anything--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\"\n",

      "on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.\n",
      "I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.  In a country\n",
      "life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have\n",
      "ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut\n",
      "up at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,\n",

      "\n",

      "\"That I am sure you would.  Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\n",
      "Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\n",
      "warmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--\n",
      "Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention\n",
      "to me in the whole of this scheme.  You have hit upon the very thing\n",
      "to please me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.\n",
      "He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\n",
      "and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors\n",
      "to eat would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not,\n",
      "under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two\n",
      "spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was invited on good faith.  No lurking horrors were to upbraid\n",
      "him for his easy credulity.  He did consent.  He had not been\n",
      "at Donwell for two years.  \"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,\n",
      "and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.\n",
      "He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of\n",
      "the day.  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,\n",
      "and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other\n",
      "of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,\n",
      "and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.\n",
      "He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--\n",
      "very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not\n",
      "fond of dining out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.\n",
      "The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,\n",
      "like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular\n",
      "compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high\n",
      "expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,\n",
      "promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof\n",
      "of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--\n",
      "Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad\n",
      "to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,\n",
      "and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party\n",
      "to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell\n",
      "was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather\n",
      "appearing exactly right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,\n",
      "to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most\n",
      "comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a\n",
      "fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,\n",
      "ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise\n",
      "every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,\n",
      "and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others\n",
      "were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\n",
      "was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him,\n",
      "and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with\n",
      "more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house\n",
      "and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance\n",
      "with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,\n",
      "as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,\n",
      "its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--\n",
      "its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,\n",
      "of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,\n",
      "had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,\n",
      "which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house\n",
      "was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good\n",
      "deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,\n",
      "and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,\n",
      "and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\n",
      "for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,\n",
      "untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John\n",
      "Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.\n",
      "She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could\n",
      "raise a blush.  These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about\n",
      "and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,\n",
      "and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,\n",
      "excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;\n",
      "and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet\n",
      "and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,\n",
      "accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,\n",
      "could now be thought or spoken of.--\"The best fruit in England--\n",
      "every body's favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds\n",
      "and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way\n",
      "of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--\n",
      "every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--\n",
      "the others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--\n",
      "white wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--\n",
      "abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to\n",
      "be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--\n",
      "gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--\n",
      "only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--\n",
      "currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries\n",
      "the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--\n",
      "must go and sit in the shade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only\n",
      "once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her\n",
      "son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--\n",
      "She had some fears of his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\n",
      "to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--\n",
      "A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.  Mrs. Elton\n",
      "had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.\n",
      "It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,\n",
      "but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was\n",
      "with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,\n",
      "a lady known at Maple Grove.  Delightful, charming, superior,\n",
      "first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton\n",
      "was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,\n",
      "all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused\n",
      "to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued\n",
      "to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,\n",
      "repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--\n",
      "Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence\n",
      "by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing\n",
      "to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,\n",
      "with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--\n",
      "\"Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--\n",
      "all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.\"--The pertinacity\n",
      "of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\n",
      "dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\n",
      "followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short\n",
      "avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal\n",
      "distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--\n",
      "It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone\n",
      "wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,\n",
      "to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had\n",
      "been there.  Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such\n",
      "a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view\n",
      "which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly\n",
      "the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\n",
      "form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank\n",
      "of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--\n",
      "and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,\n",
      "rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river\n",
      "making a close and handsome curve around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,\n",
      "English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,\n",
      "without being oppressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;\n",
      "and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley\n",
      "and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was\n",
      "glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned\n",
      "her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.\n",
      "Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.  There had been a time\n",
      "also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot\n",
      "so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not.\n",
      "It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity\n",
      "and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,\n",
      "and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,\n",
      "and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.\n",
      "He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.\n",
      "and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, \"These are my\n",
      "own concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being\n",
      "suspected of introducing Robert Martin.\"--She did not suspect him.\n",
      "It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think\n",
      "of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade\n",
      "was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of\n",
      "the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--\n",
      "and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did\n",
      "not come.  Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would\n",
      "not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could\n",
      "not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.\n",
      "He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.\n",
      "\"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting\n",
      "over to them.\"--Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready\n",
      "to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint\n",
      "her nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston\n",
      "was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be\n",
      "by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--\n",
      "Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\n",
      "she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more\n",
      "to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;\n",
      "perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting\n",
      "on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,\n",
      "and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken\n",
      "his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no\n",
      "damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;\n",
      "and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston\n",
      "might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety\n",
      "which her spirits seemed to need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's\n",
      "entertainment.  Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,\n",
      "corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,\n",
      "had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;\n",
      "and the kindness had perfectly answered.  Mr. Woodhouse had been\n",
      "exceedingly well amused.  Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him,\n",
      "and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other\n",
      "resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,\n",
      "for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking\n",
      "over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake\n",
      "of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot\n",
      "of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,\n",
      "coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--\n",
      "Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start\n",
      "at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you be so kind,\" said she, \"when I am missed, as to say\n",
      "that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware\n",
      "how late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we\n",
      "shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said\n",
      "nothing about it to any body.  It would only be giving trouble\n",
      "and distress.  Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.\n",
      "Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,\n",
      "will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk\n",
      "to Highbury alone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.  I shall be at home\n",
      "in twenty minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.\n",
      "Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.\n",
      "It can be round in five minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--\n",
      "And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have\n",
      "to guard others!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,\n",
      "\"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.\n",
      "I must order the carriage.  The heat even would be danger.--You are\n",
      "fatigued already.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am,\"--she answered--\"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort\n",
      "of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all\n",
      "know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.  Mine, I confess,\n",
      "are exhausted.  The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let\n",
      "me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma had not another word to oppose.  She saw it all; and entering\n",
      "into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,\n",
      "and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.  Her parting\n",
      "look was grateful--and her parting words, \"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "the comfort of being sometimes alone!\"--seemed to burst from\n",
      "an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual\n",
      "endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who\n",
      "loved her best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!\" said Emma, as she turned back\n",
      "into the hall again.  \"I do pity you.  And the more sensibility\n",
      "you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\n",
      "accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank\n",
      "Churchill entered the room.  Emma had not been thinking of him,\n",
      "she had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston would be at ease.  The black mare was blameless;\n",
      "_they_ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.\n",
      "He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;\n",
      "a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given\n",
      "up every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot\n",
      "a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,\n",
      "he believed he should not have come at all.  The heat was excessive;\n",
      "he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid\n",
      "at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,\n",
      "etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest\n",
      "possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire,\n",
      "looking very deplorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\" said Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.  I could very\n",
      "ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!\n",
      "You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.\n",
      "I met _one_ as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's\n",
      "state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being\n",
      "out of humour.  Some people were always cross when they were hot.\n",
      "Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating\n",
      "and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,\n",
      "she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance\n",
      "of every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--he should not eat.  He was not hungry; it would only make\n",
      "him hotter.\"  In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;\n",
      "and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.  Emma returned\n",
      "all her attention to her father, saying in secret--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad I have done being in love with him.  I should not like a\n",
      "man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.  Harriet's sweet\n",
      "easy temper will not mind it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\n",
      "back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,\n",
      "like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest\n",
      "in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he\n",
      "should be so late.  He was not in his best spirits, but seemed\n",
      "trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense\n",
      "very agreeably.  They were looking over views in Swisserland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\" said he.\n",
      "\"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places.\n",
      "You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour\n",
      "to read--or my poem.  I shall do something to expose myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.  You will\n",
      "never go to Swisserland.  Your uncle and aunt will never allow\n",
      "you to leave England.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They may be induced to go too.  A warm climate may be prescribed\n",
      "for her.  I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad.\n",
      "I assure you I have.  I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,\n",
      "that I shall soon be abroad.  I ought to travel.  I am tired\n",
      "of doing nothing.  I want a change.  I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--\n",
      "and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.  Cannot you invent\n",
      "a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence!  You are quite mistaken.\n",
      "I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.  I am\n",
      "thwarted in every thing material.  I do not consider myself at all\n",
      "a fortunate person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.\n",
      "Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.\n",
      "Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,\n",
      "will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--I shall not stir.  I shall sit by you.  You are my best cure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.\n",
      "It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young\n",
      "man so much in want of a change.  You will stay, and go with us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--It will not be worth while.  If I come, I shall be cross.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then pray stay at Richmond.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.  I can never bear to think\n",
      "of you all there without me.\"\n",

      "They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\n",
      "circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,\n",
      "were in favour of a pleasant party.  Mr. Weston directed the whole,\n",
      "officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every\n",
      "body was in good time.  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates\n",
      "and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.\n",
      "Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting\n",
      "but to be happy when they got there.  Seven miles were travelled\n",
      "in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration\n",
      "on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there\n",
      "was deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union,\n",
      "which could not be got over.  They separated too much into parties.\n",
      "The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss\n",
      "Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\n",
      "And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.  It seemed\n",
      "at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,\n",
      "and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours\n",
      "that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,\n",
      "between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any\n",
      "cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first it was downright dulness to Emma.  She had never seen Frank\n",
      "Churchill so silent and stupid.  He said nothing worth hearing--\n",
      "looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without\n",
      "knowing what she said.  While he was so dull, it was no wonder that\n",
      "Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\n",
      "for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\n",
      "Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\n",
      "To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\n",
      "cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\n",
      "was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,\n",
      "the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first\n",
      "and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,\n",
      "in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most\n",
      "people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English\n",
      "word but flirtation could very well describe.  \"Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
      "and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively.\"  They were laying\n",
      "themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off\n",
      "in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.\n",
      "Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;\n",
      "it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected.\n",
      "She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him\n",
      "for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\n",

      "\"Your command?--Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\n",
      "somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your\n",
      "own management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot\n",
      "be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your\n",
      "own command rather than mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It comes to the same thing.  I can have no self-command without\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Dating from three o'clock yesterday.  My perpetual influence\n",

      "\"Three o'clock yesterday!  That is your date.  I thought I had seen\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.  But (lowering her voice)--\n",

      "\n",

      "\"I saw you first in February.  Let every body on the Hill hear me if\n",
      "they can.  Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking\n",
      "on the other.  I saw you first in February.\"  And then whispering--\n",
      "\"Our companions are excessively stupid.  What shall we do to rouse them?\n",
      "Any nonsense will serve.  They _shall_ talk.  Ladies and gentlemen,\n",
      "I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)\n",
      "to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal;\n",
      "Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding;\n",
      "Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are\n",
      "all thinking of?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Upon no account in the world.  It is the very last thing I\n",
      "would stand the brunt of just now.  Let me hear any thing rather\n",
      "than what you are all thinking of.  I will not say quite all.\n",
      "There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)\n",
      "whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a sort of thing,\" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,\n",
      "\"which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to\n",

      "_I_ never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,\n",
      "in reply,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It will not do,\" whispered Frank to Emma; \"they are most\n",

      "Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she\n",
      "waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,\n",
      "and only requires something very entertaining from each of you,\n",
      "in a general way.  Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she\n",
      "is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only\n",
      "demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose\n",
      "or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--\n",
      "or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily\n",
      "at them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! very well,\" exclaimed Miss Bates, \"then I need not be uneasy.\n",
      "`Three things very dull indeed.'  That will just do for me, you know.\n",
      "I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open\n",
      "my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured\n",
      "dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not resist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty.  Pardon me--but you\n",

      "\n",
      "Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\n",
      "immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could\n",
      "not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!--well--to be sure.  Yes, I see what she means, (turning to\n",
      "Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.  I must make\n",
      "myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing\n",
      "to an old friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like your plan,\" cried Mr. Weston.  \"Agreed, agreed.  I will do\n",
      "my best.  I am making a conundrum.  How will a conundrum reckon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,\" answered his son;--\"but we shall\n",
      "be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said Emma, \"it will not reckon low.  A conundrum of\n",
      "Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour.  Come, sir,\n",
      "pray let me hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I doubt its being very clever myself,\" said Mr. Weston.\n",
      "\"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters\n",
      "of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What two letters!--express perfection!  I am sure I do not know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! you will never guess.  You, (to Emma), I am certain, will\n",
      "never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding and gratification came together.  It might be a very\n",
      "indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh\n",
      "at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem\n",
      "to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid\n",
      "about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\n",
      "has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every\n",
      "body else.  _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\" said Mrs. Elton;\n",
      "\"_I_ really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.\n",
      "I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not\n",
      "at all pleased with.  I knew who it came from.  An abominable puppy!--\n",
      "You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things\n",
      "are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;\n",
      "but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring\n",
      "about the country in summer.  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.\n",
      "I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service.\n",
      "I do not pretend to be a wit.  I have a great deal of vivacity\n",
      "in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak\n",
      "and when to hold my tongue.  Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.\n",
      "Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.  We have nothing clever to say--\n",
      "not one of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\" added her husband, with a sort of\n",
      "sneering consciousness; \"_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.  An old married man--\n",
      "quite good for nothing.  Shall we walk, Augusta?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all my heart.  I am really tired of exploring so long\n",
      "on one spot.  Come, Jane, take my other arm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\n",
      "\"Happy couple!\" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out\n",
      "of hearing:--\"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as\n",
      "they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only\n",
      "knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!  Peculiarly lucky!--\n",
      "for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,\n",
      "or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be\n",
      "no knowledge.  It is only by seeing women in their own homes,\n",
      "among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form\n",
      "any just judgment.  Short of that, it is all guess and luck--\n",
      "and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself\n",
      "on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her\n",
      "own confederates, spoke now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such things do occur, undoubtedly.\"--She was stopped by a cough.\n",
      "Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were speaking,\" said he, gravely.  She recovered her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\n",
      "do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them\n",
      "to be very frequent.  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--\n",
      "but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.  I would\n",
      "be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,\n",
      "(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)\n",
      "who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,\n",
      "an oppression for ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\n",
      "afterwards said, in a lively tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever\n",
      "I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.  Will you?\n",
      "(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I\n",
      "should like any body fixed on by you.  You provide for the family,\n",
      "you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.\n",
      "I am in no hurry.  Adopt her, educate her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And make her like myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means, if you can.\"\n",

      "I shall come to you for my wife.  Remember.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was in no danger of forgetting.  It was a commission to touch every\n",
      "favourite feeling.  Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\n",
      "Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\n",
      "He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;\n",
      "who could say?  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, ma'am,\" said Jane to her aunt, \"shall we join Mrs. Elton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please, my dear.  With all my heart.  I am quite ready.\n",
      "I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.\n",
      "We shall soon overtake her.  There she is--no, that's somebody else.\n",
      "That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--\n",
      "Well, I declare--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young\n",
      "man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.  Even Emma grew\n",
      "tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather\n",
      "walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,\n",
      "and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful\n",
      "views beneath her.  The appearance of the servants looking out\n",
      "for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;\n",
      "and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,\n",
      "and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_ carriage first,\n",
      "were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was\n",
      "to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.\n",
      "Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\n",
      "she hoped never to be betrayed into again.\n",
      "\n",
      "While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.\n",
      "He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:\n",
      "a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still\n",
      "use it.  I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.\n",
      "How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?  How could you be so\n",
      "insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--\n",
      "Emma, I had not thought it possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\n",
      "It was not so very bad.  I dare say she did not understand me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I assure you she did.  She felt your full meaning.  She has talked\n",
      "of it since.  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--\n",
      "with what candour and generosity.  I wish you could have heard her\n",
      "honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,\n",
      "as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,\n",
      "when her society must be so irksome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Emma, \"I know there is not a better creature in the world:\n",
      "but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are\n",
      "most unfortunately blended in her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are blended,\" said he, \"I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\n",
      "I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous\n",
      "over the good.  Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every\n",
      "harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you\n",
      "for any liberties of manner.  Were she your equal in situation--\n",
      "but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.  She is poor;\n",
      "she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live\n",
      "to old age, must probably sink more.  Her situation should secure\n",
      "your compassion.  It was badly done, indeed!  You, whom she had known\n",
      "from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her\n",
      "notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,\n",
      "and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before\n",
      "her niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly _some_,)\n",
      "would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her.--This is not\n",
      "pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;\n",
      "but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\n",
      "satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,\n",
      "and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice\n",
      "than you can do now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;\n",
      "it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.\n",
      "He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,\n",
      "and her tongue motionless.  They were combined only of anger\n",
      "against herself, mortification, and deep concern.  She had not\n",
      "been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back\n",
      "for a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken\n",
      "no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,\n",
      "she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;\n",
      "but it was just too late.  He had turned away, and the horses were\n",
      "in motion.  She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,\n",
      "with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,\n",
      "and every thing left far behind.  She was vexed beyond what could\n",
      "have been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal.\n",
      "Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance\n",
      "in her life.  She was most forcibly struck.  The truth of this\n",
      "representation there was no denying.  She felt it at her heart.\n",
      "How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!  How could\n",
      "she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!\n",
      "And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,\n",
      "of concurrence, of common kindness!\n",
      "\n",
      "Time did not compose her.  As she reflected more, she seemed\n",
      "but to feel it more.  She never had been so depressed.  Happily it\n",
      "was not necessary to speak.  There was only Harriet, who seemed not\n",
      "in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma\n",
      "felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,\n",
      "without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.\n",

      "The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all\n",
      "the evening.  How it might be considered by the rest of the party,\n",
      "she could not tell.  They, in their different homes, and their different\n",
      "ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it\n",
      "was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\n",
      "satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,\n",
      "than any she had ever passed.  A whole evening of back-gammon with\n",
      "her father, was felicity to it.  _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure,\n",
      "for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four\n",
      "to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree\n",
      "of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her\n",
      "general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.  As a daughter,\n",
      "she hoped she was not without a heart.  She hoped no one could\n",
      "have said to her, \"How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--\n",
      "I must, I will tell you truths while I can.\"  Miss Bates should\n",
      "never again--no, never!  If attention, in future, could do away\n",
      "the past, she might hope to be forgiven.  She had been often remiss,\n",
      "her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought\n",
      "than fact; scornful, ungracious.  But it should be so no more.\n",
      "In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the\n",
      "very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,\n",
      "of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,\n",
      "that nothing might prevent her.  It was not unlikely, she thought,\n",
      "that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might\n",
      "come in while she were paying her visit.  She had no objection.\n",
      "She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly\n",
      "and truly hers.  Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she\n",
      "saw him not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ladies were all at home.\"  She had never rejoiced at the sound\n",
      "before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\n",
      "with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,\n",
      "or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\n",
      "She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry;\n",
      "the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased\n",
      "to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.  The aunt and\n",
      "niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.  Jane she had\n",
      "a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door\n",
      "had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, \"Well, my dear,\n",
      "I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are\n",
      "ill enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she\n",
      "did not quite understand what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid Jane is not very well,\" said she, \"but I do not know;\n",
      "they _tell_ me she is well.  I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse.  I hope you find a chair.  I wish Hetty had not gone.\n",
      "I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where\n",
      "you like?  I am sure she will be here presently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma seriously hoped she would.  She had a moment's fear of Miss\n",
      "Bates keeping away from her.  But Miss Bates soon came--\"Very happy\n",
      "and obliged\"--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the\n",
      "same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.\n",
      "A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead\n",
      "the way to a return of old feelings.  The touch seemed immediate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!  Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--\n",
      "and are come to give us joy.  This does not seem much like joy,\n",
      "indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be\n",
      "very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,\n",
      "and she has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--\n",
      "such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,\n",
      "and Mrs. Dixon.  `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'--\n",
      "for tears were in her eyes perpetually.  One cannot wonder,\n",
      "one cannot wonder.  It is a great change; and though she is\n",
      "amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman\n",
      "before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing\n",
      "her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache\n",
      "she has.  When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\n",
      "any blessing quite as it may deserve.  She is as low as possible.\n",
      "To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she\n",
      "is to have secured such a situation.  You will excuse her not\n",
      "coming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--\n",
      "I want her to lie down upon the bed.  `My dear,' said I, `I shall\n",
      "say you are laid down upon the bed:'  but, however, she is not;\n",
      "she is walking about the room.  But, now that she has written\n",
      "her letters, she says she shall soon be well.  She will be extremely\n",
      "sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will\n",
      "excuse her.  You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--\n",
      "but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we\n",
      "had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did\n",
      "not know any body was coming.  `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I,\n",
      "`depend upon it.  Nobody else would come so early.'  `Well,' said she,\n",
      "`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'\n",
      "But then Patty came in, and said it was you.  `Oh!' said I,\n",
      "`it is Miss Woodhouse:  I am sure you will like to see her.'--\n",
      "`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away;\n",
      "and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry\n",
      "and ashamed we were.  `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must,\n",
      "and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was most sincerely interested.  Her heart had been long growing\n",
      "kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\n",
      "as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\n",
      "but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\n",
      "sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\n",
      "naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,\n",
      "when she might not bear to see herself.  She spoke as she felt,\n",
      "with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the\n",
      "circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually\n",
      "determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage\n",
      "and comfort as possible.  \"It must be a severe trial to them all.\n",
      "She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So very kind!\" replied Miss Bates.  \"But you are always kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no bearing such an \"always;\" and to break through her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have\n",
      "the charge of her three little girls--delightful children.\n",
      "Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;\n",
      "if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's;\n",
      "but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very\n",

      "when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,\n",
      "the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,\n",
      "she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the\n",
      "reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind\n",
      "to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing\n",
      "should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she\n",
      "told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more\n",
      "idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.  It is not\n",
      "every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,\n",
      "and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she\n",
      "would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;\n",
      "she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all\n",
      "settled that Jane should go.  Quite a surprize to me!  I had not\n",
      "the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,\n",
      "that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,\n",
      "she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word\n",
      "of it till it was all settled.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\n",
      "him off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\n",
      "and a very agreeable evening we had.  Such kind friends, you know,\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body\n",
      "seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.  Even pleasure,\n",
      "you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed\n",
      "very much to have enjoyed it.  However, _I_ shall always think it\n",
      "a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends\n",
      "who included me in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\n",

      "\"I dare say she had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all\n",

      "that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.  Yes, indeed, there is every thing\n",
      "in the world that can make her happy in it.  Except the Sucklings\n",
      "and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,\n",
      "so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.\n",
      "Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost\n",
      "equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little\n",
      "Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet\n",
      "children anywhere.  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--\n",
      "It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--\n",
      "I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah! madam,\" cried Emma, \"if other children are at all like what I\n",

      "dearly earned.\"\n",

      "Within a fortnight.  Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.  My poor\n",
      "mother does not know how to bear it.  So then, I try to put it out of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel\n",

      "before their return?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such\n",
      "a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.\n",
      "I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying\n",
      "to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating\n",
      "me upon it!  It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea,\n",
      "because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,\n",
      "because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;\n",
      "something happened before tea, but not that.  Mr. Elton was called\n",
      "out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak\n",
      "with him.  Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk\n",
      "to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is\n",
      "bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--\n",
      "I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she\n",
      "gets out at all.  And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton\n",
      "about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,\n",
      "you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\n",
      "of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\n",
      "and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler\n",
      "had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having\n",
      "been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.\n",
      "That was what happened before tea.  It was after tea that Jane spoke\n",
      "to Mrs. Elton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly\n",
      "new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it\n",
      "possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars\n",
      "of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all,\n",
      "it was of no consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\n",
      "accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge\n",
      "of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over\n",
      "from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--\n",
      "which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;\n",
      "and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,\n",
      "upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only\n",
      "wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;\n",
      "but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,\n",
      "without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,\n",
      "Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the\n",
      "ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,\n",
      "and driving very steady.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,\n",
      "and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject\n",
      "which already engaged her mind.  The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's\n",
      "importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was\n",
      "every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference\n",
      "of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\n",
      "till roused by Miss Bates's saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.  What is to become\n",
      "of that?--Very true.  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--\n",
      "`You must go,' said she.  `You and I must part.  You will have no\n",
      "business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroom\n",
      "till Colonel Campbell comes back.  I shall talk about it to him;\n",
      "he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--\n",
      "And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his\n",
      "present or his daughter's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance\n",
      "of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\n",
      "that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been\n",
      "long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could\n",
      "venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\n",

      "Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were\n",
      "sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a\n",
      "manner decidedly graver than usual, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\n",

      "her father began his inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you\n",
      "find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must\n",

      "She is always so attentive to them!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\n",
      "and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--\n",
      "It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,\n",
      "as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had\n",
      "passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\n",
      "He looked at her with a glow of regard.  She was warmly gratified--\n",
      "and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of\n",
      "more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--\n",
      "whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--\n",
      "she might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,\n",
      "pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--\n",
      "when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel\n",
      "such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,\n",
      "she could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,\n",
      "if he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;\n",
      "and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,\n",
      "or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--\n",
      "It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--\n",
      "She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.\n",
      "It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--\n",
      "gone in a moment.  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which\n",

      "Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,\n",
      "for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have\n",
      "happened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,\n",
      "would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;\n",
      "she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,\n",
      "and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she\n",
      "had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them\n",
      "half an hour, she found.  It was a pity that she had not come\n",
      "back earlier!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness\n",
      "of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly;\n",
      "and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\n",
      "Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence\n",
      "on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--\n",
      "interested, without disturbing him.  He had long made up his mind to Jane\n",
      "Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,\n",
      "but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so\n",
      "comfortably settled.  Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,\n",
      "and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought\n",
      "to be.  I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health\n",
      "will be taken good care of.  It ought to be a first object,\n",
      "as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.  You know,\n",
      "my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\n",

      "The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every\n",
      "thing else into the background.  An express arrived at Randalls\n",
      "to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!  Though her nephew\n",
      "had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,\n",
      "she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return.\n",
      "A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded\n",
      "by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle.\n",
      "The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was felt as such things must be felt.  Every body had a\n",
      "degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,\n",
      "solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,\n",
      "curiosity to know where she would be buried.  Goldsmith tells us,\n",
      "that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do\n",
      "but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally\n",
      "to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,\n",
      "after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of\n",
      "with compassionate allowances.  In one point she was fully justified.\n",
      "She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.  The event\n",
      "acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness\n",
      "of imaginary complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\n",
      "more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try\n",
      "the temper.  It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,\n",
      "what would Mr. Churchill do without her?  Mr. Churchill's loss\n",
      "would be dreadful indeed.  Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\"--\n",
      "Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,\n",
      "\"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!\" and resolved, that his\n",
      "mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing\n",
      "and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,\n",
      "true and steady.  How it would affect Frank was among the earliest\n",
      "thoughts of both.  It was also a very early speculation with Emma.\n",
      "The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind\n",
      "glanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested\n",
      "with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,\n",
      "how benefited, how freed.  She saw in a moment all the possible good.\n",
      "Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter.\n",
      "Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;\n",
      "an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.\n",
      "All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\n",
      "the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\n",
      "no certainty of its being already formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\n",
      "What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.  Emma was\n",
      "gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\n",
      "and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\n",
      "They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating\n",
      "all that was immediately important of their state and plans.\n",
      "Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their\n",
      "first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,\n",
      "was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom\n",
      "Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.\n",
      "At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes\n",
      "for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,\n",
      "whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose\n",
      "engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished\n",
      "to shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.\n",
      "She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;\n",
      "and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now\n",
      "the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of\n",
      "regard or sympathy.  She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew\n",
      "a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration.\n",
      "She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield.\n",
      "A note was written to urge it.  The invitation was refused, and by\n",
      "a verbal message.  \"Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;\"\n",
      "and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,\n",
      "it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\n",
      "though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\n",
      "under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made\n",
      "him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the\n",
      "time proposed.  Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--\n",
      "appetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely\n",
      "alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,\n",
      "which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was\n",
      "uneasy about her.  He thought she had undertaken more than she\n",
      "was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would\n",
      "not own it.  Her spirits seemed overcome.  Her present home,\n",
      "he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--\n",
      "confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--\n",
      "and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge\n",
      "to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.\n",
      "Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,\n",
      "only too great.  He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more\n",
      "evil than good from them.  Emma listened with the warmest concern;\n",
      "grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover\n",
      "some way of being useful.  To take her--be it only an hour\n",
      "or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,\n",
      "and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,\n",
      "might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,\n",
      "in the most feeling language she could command, that she would\n",
      "call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--\n",
      "mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour\n",
      "of such exercise for his patient.  The answer was only in this\n",
      "short note:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal\n",
      "to any exercise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it\n",
      "was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality\n",
      "shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she\n",
      "might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.\n",
      "In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove\n",
      "to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--\n",
      "but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,\n",
      "and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of\n",
      "the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--\n",
      "but all in vain.  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;\n",
      "Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out\n",
      "seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,\n",
      "and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,\n",
      "Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on\n",
      "no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.  \"Indeed, the truth was,\n",
      "that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made\n",
      "such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,\n",
      "Jane would really see nobody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\n",
      "and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;\n",
      "neither could she feel any right of preference herself--\n",
      "she submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther\n",
      "as to her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able\n",
      "to assist.  On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,\n",
      "and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--\n",
      "Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could\n",
      "command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\n",
      "examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\n",
      "was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.\n",
      "In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks\n",
      "from Miss Bates, but \"dear Jane would not be satisfied without its\n",
      "being sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,\n",
      "she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\n",
      "about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon\n",
      "of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal\n",
      "to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in\n",
      "the carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--\n",
      "that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_.  She was sorry,\n",
      "very sorry.  Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed\n",
      "but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,\n",
      "inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified\n",
      "her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed\n",
      "so little worthy as a friend:  but she had the consolation of knowing\n",
      "that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,\n",
      "that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts\n",
      "of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,\n",
      "he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease,\n",
      "Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \"could not stay\n",
      "five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.\"--\n",
      "He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,\n",
      "in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,\n",
      "unheard by her father,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it\n",
      "be possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is she unwell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have\n",
      "ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_,\n",
      "and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to\n",
      "refuse what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?--\n",
      "Is she really not ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it\n",
      "all in time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.\n",
      "Something really important seemed announced by his looks;\n",
      "but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,\n",
      "and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,\n",
      "she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on\n",
      "their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\n",
      "\"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don't ask me.  I promised my wife\n",
      "to leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can.\n",
      "Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Break it to me,\" cried Emma, standing still with terror.--\n",
      "\"Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened\n",
      "in Brunswick Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell\n",
      "me this moment what it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed you are mistaken.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\n",
      "friends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?--\n",
      "I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, Emma.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,\n",
      "that it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!--What can\n",
      "be to be _broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my honour,\" said he very seriously, \"it does not.  It is not\n",
      "in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name\n",
      "of Knightley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\n",
      "I should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern you--\n",
      "it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,\n",
      "my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.\n",
      "I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might\n",
      "be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.\n",
      "She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,\n",
      "and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some\n",
      "money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable\n",
      "nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late\n",
      "event at Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active.\n",
      "Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--\n",
      "This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.\n",
      "It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who is that gentleman on horseback?\" said she, as they proceeded--\n",
      "speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with\n",
      "any other view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,\n",
      "I assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor\n",
      "by this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has your son been with you, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more\n",
      "guarded and demure,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well, my dear,\"\n",
      "said he, as they entered the room--\"I have brought her, and now\n",
      "I hope you will soon be better.  I shall leave you together.\n",
      "There is no use in delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.\"--\n",
      "And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he\n",
      "quitted the room,--\"I have been as good as my word.  She has not the\n",
      "least idea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\n",
      "that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,\n",
      "she eagerly said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature,\n",
      "I find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.\n",
      "I have been walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both\n",
      "abhor suspense.  Do not let mine continue longer.  It will do you\n",
      "good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you indeed no idea?\" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n",
      "\"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you\n",
      "are to hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\"\n",
      "(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)\n",
      "\"He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.\n",
      "It is impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his\n",
      "father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then\n",
      "of Harriet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than an attachment, indeed,\" resumed Mrs. Weston; \"an engagement--\n",
      "a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any\n",
      "body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax\n",
      "are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\n",
      "and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\n",
      "\"You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been a solemn\n",
      "engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,\n",
      "and kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it\n",
      "but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--\n",
      "It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,\n",
      "it is yet almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.--\n",
      "I thought I knew him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between\n",
      "two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;\n",
      "and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,\n",
      "and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said she at last, trying to recover herself; \"this is a\n",
      "circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I\n",
      "can at all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--\n",
      "before either of them came to Highbury?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,\n",
      "Emma, very much.  It has hurt his father equally.  _Some_ _part_\n",
      "of his conduct we cannot excuse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, \"I will not pretend\n",
      "_not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,\n",
      "be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,\n",
      "as you are apprehensive of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance\n",
      "was as steady as her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\n",
      "present perfect indifference,\" she continued, \"I will farther tell you,\n",
      "that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,\n",
      "when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be\n",
      "attached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,\n",
      "is perhaps the wonder.  Fortunately, however, it did cease.\n",
      "I have really for some time past, for at least these three months,\n",
      "cared nothing about him.  You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "This is the simple truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could\n",
      "find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done\n",
      "her more good than any thing else in the world could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\" said she.\n",
      "\"On this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you\n",
      "might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\n",
      "Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of\n",
      "grateful wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit _him_,\n",
      "Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.\n",
      "What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,\n",
      "and with manners so _very_ disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour\n",
      "to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with\n",
      "persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged\n",
      "to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--\n",
      "How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--\n",
      "very wrong, very wrong indeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!\n",
      "to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\n",
      "before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\n",
      "which I can neither comprehend nor respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said\n",
      "so expressly.  He had not time to enter into much explanation.\n",
      "He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation\n",
      "which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--\n",
      "but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.\n",
      "The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;\n",
      "and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the\n",
      "impropriety of his conduct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.\n",
      "Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how\n",
      "it has sunk him in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!--\n",
      "None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth\n",
      "and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man\n",
      "should display in every transaction of his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been\n",
      "wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer\n",
      "for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too!\n",
      "Jane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he\n",
      "mean by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--\n",
      "to suffer her even to think of such a measure!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully\n",
      "acquit him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated\n",
      "to him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--\n",
      "Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.\n",
      "They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--\n",
      "and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project\n",
      "of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it\n",
      "all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,\n",
      "put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been\n",
      "carrying on so long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma began to listen better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston.  \"He told me\n",
      "at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\n",
      "seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.\n",
      "Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations.\n",
      "It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are\n",
      "not to be understood.  Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in\n",
      "a hurry to condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him;\n",
      "and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,\n",
      "I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready\n",
      "to hope that it may.  They must both have suffered a great deal\n",
      "under such a system of secresy and concealment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_His_ sufferings,\" replied Emma dryly, \"do not appear to have done\n",
      "him much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely\n",
      "a difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done\n",
      "in that family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there\n",
      "could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely\n",
      "are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is\n",
      "persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required.\n",
      "What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--\n",
      "He gave his consent with very little persuasion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" thought Emma, \"he would have done as much for Harriet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light\n",
      "this morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,\n",
      "some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get\n",
      "back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,\n",
      "that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--\n",
      "He was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made\n",
      "him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen\n",
      "him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of\n",
      "finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--\n",
      "and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on\n",
      "with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none\n",
      "of them know of the engagement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no\n",
      "being in the world but their two selves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Emma, \"I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled\n",
      "to the idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always\n",
      "think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been\n",
      "but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--\n",
      "To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;\n",
      "and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,\n",
      "the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves\n",
      "all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the\n",
      "midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting\n",
      "in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both\n",
      "to hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each\n",
      "other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am quite easy on that head,\" replied Mrs. Weston.  \"I am\n",
      "very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,\n",
      "which both might not have heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,\n",
      "when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\n",
      "Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;\n",
      "and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\n",
      "evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited\n",
      "him in; and, while he was coming round, added, \"Now, dearest Emma,\n",
      "let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his\n",
      "heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.\n",
      "Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may\n",
      "be fairly said in her favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify;\n",
      "but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it\n",
      "may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,\n",
      "that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness\n",
      "of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--\n",
      "and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this\n",
      "one great deviation from the strict rule of right.  And how much\n",
      "may be said in her situation for even that error!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly.  \"If a woman can ever\n",
      "be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation\n",
      "like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the\n",
      "world is not their's, nor the world's law.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\n",
      "exclaiming,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!\n",
      "This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,\n",
      "and exercise my talent of guessing.  But you really frightened me.\n",
      "I thought you had lost half your property, at least.  And here,\n",
      "instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one\n",
      "of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,\n",
      "on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished\n",
      "young women in England for your daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was\n",
      "as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\n",
      "was immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness:\n",
      "he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered\n",
      "on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted\n",
      "time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.\n",
      "His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,\n",
      "or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all\n",
      "over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,\n",
      "in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,\n",
      "and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could\n",
      "possibly have done.\n",

      "CHAPTER XI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harriet, poor Harriet!\"--Those were the words; in them lay the\n",
      "tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\n",
      "the real misery of the business to her.  Frank Churchill had behaved\n",
      "very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much\n",
      "_his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him.\n",
      "It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account,\n",
      "that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second\n",
      "time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley\n",
      "had spoken prophetically, when he once said, \"Emma, you have been\n",
      "no friend to Harriet Smith.\"--She was afraid she had done her nothing\n",
      "but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,\n",
      "in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original\n",
      "author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might\n",
      "otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet\n",
      "had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill\n",
      "before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt\n",
      "completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.\n",
      "She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.\n",
      "Her influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious\n",
      "that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been\n",
      "risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.\n",
      "Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she\n",
      "must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five\n",
      "hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--\"But, with\n",
      "common sense,\" she added, \"I am afraid I have had little to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was extremely angry with herself.  If she could not have been\n",
      "angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--\n",
      "As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings\n",
      "from any present solicitude on her account.  Harriet would\n",
      "be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,\n",
      "whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,\n",
      "must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil\n",
      "were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--\n",
      "Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.\n",
      "This discovery laid many smaller matters open.  No doubt it had been\n",
      "from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might\n",
      "any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.\n",
      "An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\n",
      "and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.\n",
      "She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself\n",
      "from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged\n",
      "that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond\n",
      "her desert.  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!\n",
      "There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.\n",
      "Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be\n",
      "more severe than the first.  Considering the very superior claims\n",
      "of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect\n",
      "on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--\n",
      "She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon\n",
      "as possible.  An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's\n",
      "parting words.  \"For the present, the whole affair was to be\n",
      "completely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,\n",
      "as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\n",
      "and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\"--\n",
      "Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her\n",
      "superior duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,\n",
      "that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to\n",
      "perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.\n",
      "The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\n",
      "she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.  Her heart beat\n",
      "quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed,\n",
      "had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.\n",
      "Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--\n",
      "But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\n",
      "\"is not this the oddest news that ever was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What news do you mean?\" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look\n",
      "or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About Jane Fairfax.  Did you ever hear any thing so strange?\n",
      "Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has\n",
      "told me himself.  I met him just now.  He told me it was to be\n",
      "a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning\n",
      "it to any body but you, but he said you knew it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did Mr. Weston tell you?\"--said Emma, still perplexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately\n",
      "engaged to one another this long while.  How very odd!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,\n",
      "that Emma did not know how to understand it.  Her character appeared\n",
      "absolutely changed.  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,\n",
      "or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.  Emma looked\n",
      "at her, quite unable to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had you any idea,\" cried Harriet, \"of his being in love\n",
      "with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)\n",
      "who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" said Emma, \"I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\n",
      "Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\n",
      "to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--\n",
      "encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had\n",
      "the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\n",
      "Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.  You may be\n",
      "very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!\" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  \"Why should you\n",
      "caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\"\n",
      "replied Emma, smiling; \"but you do not mean to deny that there\n",
      "was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason\n",
      "to understand that you did care about him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him!--never, never.  Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\"\n",
      "turning away distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--\"What do you mean?--\n",
      "Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she\n",
      "sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned\n",
      "from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,\n",
      "it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not have thought it possible,\" she began, \"that you\n",
      "could have misunderstood me!  I know we agreed never to name him--\n",
      "but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,\n",
      "I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed\n",
      "to mean any other person.  Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!  I do not\n",
      "know who would ever look at him in the company of the other.\n",
      "I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,\n",
      "who is like nobody by his side.  And that you should have been\n",
      "so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you\n",
      "entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,\n",
      "I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\n",
      "to dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not told me\n",
      "that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\n",
      "matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--\n",
      "I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought\n",
      "it possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us\n",
      "understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.\n",
      "Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure I am.  I never could have an idea of any body else--\n",
      "and so I thought you knew.  When we talked about him, it was as clear\n",
      "as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" returned Emma, with forced calmness, \"for all that\n",
      "you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.\n",
      "I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.\n",
      "I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,\n",
      "in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I\n",
      "said on the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at\n",
      "your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,\n",
      "it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself\n",
      "very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning\n",
      "even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward\n",
      "to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear,\" cried Harriet, \"now I recollect what you mean; but I\n",
      "was thinking of something very different at the time.  It was not\n",
      "the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with\n",
      "some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--\n",
      "of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton\n",
      "would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in\n",
      "the room.  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence\n",

      "how superior he was to every other being upon earth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--\n",
      "most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?\n",
      "At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,\n",
      "if the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\" she resumed, \"that you should feel\n",
      "a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.\n",
      "You must think one five hundred million times more above me than\n",
      "the other.  But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--\n",
      "strange as it may appear--.  But you know they were your own words,\n",
      "that _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity\n",
      "had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,\n",
      "it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--\n",
      "and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--\n",
      "if Mr. Knightley should really--if _he_ does not mind the disparity,\n",
      "I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,\n",
      "and try to put difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that,\n",
      "I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round\n",
      "to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\"I must say\n",
      "that I have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\n",
      "in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient\n",
      "for making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers,\n",
      "once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--\n",
      "she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it\n",
      "so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "than with Frank Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased\n",
      "by Harriet's having some hope of a return?  It darted through her,\n",
      "with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one\n",
      "but herself!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the\n",
      "same few minutes.  She saw it all with a clearness which had\n",
      "never blessed her before.  How improperly had she been acting\n",
      "by Harriet!  How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,\n",
      "how unfeeling had been her conduct!  What blindness, what madness,\n",
      "had led her on!  It struck her with dreadful force, and she\n",
      "was ready to give it every bad name in the world.  Some portion\n",
      "of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--\n",
      "some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice\n",
      "by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl\n",
      "who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\n",
      "that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)\n",
      "gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,\n",
      "with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit\n",
      "that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;\n",
      "and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest\n",
      "which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve\n",
      "to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--\n",
      "Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,\n",
      "she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed\n",
      "the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,\n",
      "the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--\n",
      "Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\n",
      "to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\n",
      "and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,\n",
      "to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\n",
      "delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,\n",
      "were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.\n",
      "Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation\n",
      "that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,\n",
      "such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--\n",
      "She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward\n",
      "patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,\n",
      "or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;\n",
      "but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and\n",
      "tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--\n",
      "especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory\n",
      "brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\n",
      "those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\n",
      "found her much superior to his expectation.  From that evening,\n",
      "or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her\n",
      "to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking\n",
      "to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having\n",
      "indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness\n",
      "and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.\n",
      "When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked\n",
      "by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be\n",
      "acquainted with her.  Emma knew it to have been very much the case.\n",
      "She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--\n",
      "Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--\n",
      "and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\n",
      "known of his opinion of Harriet.  He praised her for being without\n",
      "art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--\n",
      "She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt\n",
      "on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory,\n",
      "many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,\n",
      "a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,\n",
      "a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\n",
      "by Emma.  Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,\n",
      "and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\n",
      "undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences\n",
      "to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not\n",
      "without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,\n",
      "was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk\n",
      "at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,\n",
      "and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from\n",
      "the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more\n",
      "particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular\n",
      "way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed\n",
      "to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--\n",
      "But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,\n",
      "he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--\n",
      "The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\n",
      "before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his\n",
      "being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said\n",
      "that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,\n",
      "during their conversation, that though he must go to London,\n",
      "it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,\n",
      "which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.\n",
      "The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one\n",
      "article marked, gave her severe pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,\n",
      "after a little reflection, venture the following question.\n",
      "\"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,\n",
      "into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--\n",
      "he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?  But Harriet rejected\n",
      "the suspicion with spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Martin!  No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.\n",
      "I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be\n",
      "suspected of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she,\n",
      "\"but for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let\n",
      "his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem\n",
      "to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,\n",
      "it will not be any thing so very wonderful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\n",
      "feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side,\n",
      "to enable her to say on reply,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is\n",

      "the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;\n",
      "and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at\n",
      "that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\n",
      "father's footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was\n",
      "too much agitated to encounter him.  \"She could not compose herself--\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\"--with most ready\n",
      "encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\n",
      "another door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous\n",

      "\n",
      "The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough\n",
      "for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion\n",
      "of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.\n",
      "Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize\n",
      "must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!\n",
      "How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising\n",
      "on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her\n",
      "own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her\n",
      "own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,\n",
      "she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed\n",
      "on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing\n",
      "on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,\n",
      "and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the\n",
      "first endeavour.  To that point went every leisure moment which her\n",

      "absence of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\n",
      "declared him now to be?  When had his influence, such influence begun?--\n",
      "When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\n",
      "Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\n",
      "she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in\n",
      "her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--\n",
      "and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--\n",

      "did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when\n",
      "his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.  She saw,\n",
      "that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,\n",

      "important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;\n",
      "for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been\n",

      "to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not\n",
      "conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,\n",
      "that it would be of any consequence; for \"such things,\" he observed,\n",
      "\"always got about.\"  Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had\n",
      "very good reason for saying so.  They had gone, in short--and very\n",
      "great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.\n",
      "She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action\n",
      "had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.  The quiet,\n",
      "heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight\n",
      "of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,\n",
      "had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.  They were\n",
      "both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested\n",
      "in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,\n",
      "and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work\n",
      "for them.  Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea\n",
      "for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and\n",
      "declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the\n",
      "course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,\n",
      "overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse\n",
      "on the important subject.  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious\n",
      "silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the\n",
      "gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,\n",
      "must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,\n",
      "they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state\n",
      "of the engagement.  Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation\n",
      "must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own\n",
      "mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased\n",
      "with all that she had said on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment\n",
      "of so many months,\" continued Mrs. Weston, \"she was energetic.\n",
      "This was one of her expressions.  `I will not say, that since I\n",
      "entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I\n",
      "can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--\n",
      "and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation\n",
      "that I felt at my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor girl!\" said Emma.  \"She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\n",
      "consented to a private engagement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\n",
      "to blame herself.  `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state\n",
      "of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.  But after all the\n",
      "punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\n",
      "Pain is no expiation.  I never can be blameless.  I have been acting\n",
      "contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\n",
      "thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\n",
      "conscience tells me ought not to be.'  `Do not imagine, madam,'\n",
      "she continued, `that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection\n",
      "fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought\n",
      "me up.  The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,\n",
      "with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,\n",
      "I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor girl!\" said Emma again.  \"She loves him then excessively,\n",
      "I suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could\n",
      "be led to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered\n",
      "her judgment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid,\" returned Emma, sighing, \"that I must often have\n",
      "contributed to make her unhappy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she\n",
      "probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding\n",
      "to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.\n",
      "One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\"\n",
      "she said, \"was that of making her _unreasonable_.  The consciousness\n",
      "of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,\n",
      "and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--\n",
      "that had been--hard for him to bear.  `I did not make the allowances,'\n",
      "said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--\n",
      "his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness\n",
      "of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,\n",
      "have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'\n",
      "She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you\n",
      "had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me\n",
      "how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,\n",
      "to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and\n",
      "every endeavour to do her good.  She was sensible that you had never\n",
      "received any proper acknowledgment from herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I did not know her to be happy now,\" said Emma, seriously,\n",
      "\"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous\n",
      "conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil\n",
      "and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,\n",
      "and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.\n",
      "You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.\n",
      "They shew her to the greatest advantage.  I am sure she is very good--\n",
      "I hope she will be very happy.  It is fit that the fortune\n",
      "should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.\n",
      "She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,\n",
      "she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.\n",
      "She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--\n",
      "but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone\n",
      "to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;\n",
      "and when Mrs. Weston ended with, \"We have not yet had the letter\n",
      "we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,\"\n",
      "she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged\n",
      "to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it\n",
      "was which they were so anxious for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you well, my Emma?\" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! perfectly.  I am always well, you know.  Be sure to give me\n",
      "intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for\n",
      "unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,\n",
      "and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.  She bitterly\n",
      "regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed\n",
      "for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,\n",
      "the cause.  Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying\n",
      "that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she\n",
      "tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;\n",
      "had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;\n",
      "she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain\n",
      "which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,\n",
      "had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received\n",
      "with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that\n",
      "they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been\n",
      "admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--\n",
      "which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,\n",
      "and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable\n",
      "suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\n",
      "not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\n",
      "unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made\n",
      "a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings,\n",
      "by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's.  Of all the sources\n",
      "of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,\n",
      "she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.\n",
      "She must have been a perpetual enemy.  They never could have been\n",
      "all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace\n",
      "in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been\n",
      "the agony of a mind that would bear no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\n",
      "The weather added what it could of gloom.  A cold stormy rain set in,\n",
      "and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the\n",
      "wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made\n",
      "such cruel sights the longer visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\n",
      "comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side,\n",
      "and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.\n",
      "It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening\n",
      "of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked\n",
      "in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.\n",
      "Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those\n",
      "sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.  The picture which\n",
      "she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,\n",
      "had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures\n",
      "had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would\n",
      "experience no similar contradiction.  The prospect before her now,\n",
      "was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--\n",
      "that might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place\n",
      "that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must\n",
      "be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\n",
      "spirits only of ruined happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer\n",
      "than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied\n",
      "by it.  They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,\n",
      "her husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;\n",
      "and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease\n",
      "to belong to Highbury.  They would be married, and settled either\n",
      "at or near Enscombe.  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if\n",
      "to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would\n",
      "remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?\n",
      "Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--\n",
      "No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change\n",
      "his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured?  And if he were\n",
      "to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought\n",
      "of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted;\n",
      "if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,\n",
      "the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;\n",
      "what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far\n",
      "distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?\n",
      "\n",
      "When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain\n",
      "from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room\n",
      "for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\n",
      "or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own\n",
      "better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and\n",
      "gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life\n",
      "to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted\n",
      "with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.\n",

      "CHAPTER XIII\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather continued much the same all the following morning;\n",
      "and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to\n",
      "reign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind\n",
      "changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;\n",
      "the sun appeared; it was summer again.  With all the eagerness\n",
      "which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors\n",
      "as soon as possible.  Never had the exquisite sight, smell,\n",
      "sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,\n",
      "been more attractive to her.  She longed for the serenity they might\n",
      "gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner,\n",
      "with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill\n",
      "hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,\n",
      "and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she\n",
      "saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\n",
      "towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned\n",
      "from London.  She had been thinking of him the moment before,\n",
      "as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for\n",
      "the quickest arrangement of mind.  She must be collected and calm.\n",
      "In half a minute they were together.  The \"How d'ye do's\" were quiet\n",
      "and constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends;\n",
      "they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.\n",
      "He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,\n",
      "she found.  \"He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he\n",
      "was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\"--She thought\n",
      "he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible\n",
      "cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been\n",
      "communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner\n",
      "in which they had been received.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked together.  He was silent.  She thought he was often\n",
      "looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it\n",
      "suited her to give.  And this belief produced another dread.\n",
      "Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;\n",
      "he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,\n",
      "could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.\n",
      "He must do it all himself.  Yet she could not bear this silence.\n",
      "With him it was most unnatural.  She considered--resolved--and, trying\n",
      "to smile, began--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\n",
      "surprize you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have I?\" said he quietly, and looking at her; \"of what nature?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\n",
      "he replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard\n",
      "that already.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it possible?\" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks\n",
      "towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he\n",
      "might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,\n",
      "and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little\n",
      "more composure,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\n",
      "had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\n",
      "me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking\n",
      "voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious\n",
      "of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm\n",
      "drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him\n",
      "thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own\n",
      "excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know\n",
      "you will not allow yourself--.\"  Her arm was pressed again,\n",
      "as he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, \"The feelings\n",
      "of the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\"--\n",
      "And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, \"He will soon\n",
      "be gone.  They will soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for _her_.\n",
      "She deserves a better fate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the\n",
      "flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\n",
      "I am not in want of that sort of compassion.  My blindness to what\n",
      "was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always\n",
      "be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many\n",
      "things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I\n",
      "have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma!\" cried he, looking eagerly at her, \"are you, indeed?\"--\n",
      "but checking himself--\"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am\n",
      "pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,\n",
      "indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes\n",
      "the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your\n",
      "affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,\n",
      "from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--\n",
      "I could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference\n",
      "which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name\n",
      "of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--\n",
      "Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\n",
      "\"I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in\n",
      "your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,\n",
      "I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have\n",
      "been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might\n",
      "be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--\n",
      "But I never have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened in perfect silence.  She wished him to speak, but he\n",
      "would not.  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled\n",
      "to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower\n",
      "herself in his opinion.  She went on, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted\n",
      "by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--\n",
      "An old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened\n",
      "to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable\n",
      "in one who sets up as I do for Understanding.  Many circumstances\n",
      "assisted the temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was\n",
      "continually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,\n",
      "for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,\n",
      "they all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I\n",
      "allowed his attentions.  Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--\n",
      "I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them\n",
      "a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\n",
      "He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.  I have never been\n",
      "attached to him.  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.\n",
      "He never wished to attach me.  It was merely a blind to conceal\n",
      "his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind\n",
      "all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually\n",
      "blinded than myself--except that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my\n",
      "good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\n",
      "conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far\n",
      "as she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably\n",
      "in his usual tone, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\n",
      "however, that I may have underrated him.  My acquaintance with\n",
      "him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated\n",
      "him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has\n",
      "a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,\n",
      "whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,\n",
      "I shall certainly wish him well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no doubt of their being happy together,\" said Emma;\n",
      "\"I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a most fortunate man!\" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.\n",
      "\"So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man\n",
      "chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.  At three-and-twenty\n",
      "to have drawn such a prize!  What years of felicity that man,\n",
      "in all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of\n",
      "such a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character\n",
      "vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--\n",
      "equality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the\n",
      "habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--\n",
      "and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,\n",
      "such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the\n",
      "only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman\n",
      "a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,\n",
      "where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be the happiest\n",
      "of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.\n",
      "Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman\n",
      "at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\n",
      "by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round\n",
      "the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\n",
      "her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has\n",
      "only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--\n",
      "He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--\n",

      "\n",
      "Emma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence\n",
      "of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,\n",
      "if possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something\n",
      "totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she\n",
      "only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,\n",
      "by saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,\n",
      "I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise.\n",
      "Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it\n",
      "unsaid the next moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,\" she eagerly cried.\n",
      "\"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\n",
      "another syllable followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in her--\n",
      "perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\n",
      "She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;\n",
      "she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him\n",
      "his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,\n",
      "which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind\n",
      "as his.--They had reached the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are going in, I suppose?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner\n",
      "in which he still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn.\n",
      "Mr. Perry is not gone.\"  And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--\n",
      "\"I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,\n",
      "gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me\n",
      "as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have\n",
      "in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will\n",
      "hear whatever you like.  I will tell you exactly what I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a friend!\"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\"Emma, that I fear is\n",
      "a word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--\n",
      "I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--\n",
      "Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you\n",
      "as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\n",
      "of his eyes overpowered her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dearest Emma,\" said he, \"for dearest you will always be,\n",
      "whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest,\n",
      "most beloved Emma--tell me at once.  Say `No,' if it is to be said.\"--\n",
      "She could really say nothing.--\"You are silent,\" he cried,\n",
      "with great animation; \"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.\n",
      "The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps\n",
      "the most prominent feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\"  he soon resumed; and in a tone\n",
      "of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was\n",
      "tolerably convincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able\n",
      "to talk about it more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing\n",
      "but truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you\n",
      "have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--\n",
      "Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as\n",
      "you have borne with them.  The manner, perhaps, may have as little\n",
      "to recommend them.  God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--\n",
      "But you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--\n",
      "and will return them if you can.  At present, I ask only to hear,\n",
      "once to hear your voice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\n",
      "velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--\n",
      "to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\n",
      "Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,\n",
      "as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;\n",
      "that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying\n",
      "relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her\n",
      "own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,\n",
      "her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement\n",
      "from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,\n",
      "with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to\n",
      "rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve\n",
      "that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could\n",
      "now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment\n",
      "which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection\n",
      "from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--\n",
      "or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him\n",
      "at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he\n",
      "could not marry them both, Emma had it not.  She felt for Harriet,\n",
      "with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,\n",
      "opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.\n",
      "She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to\n",
      "her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,\n",
      "and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such\n",
      "alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.  Her way was clear,\n",
      "though not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--\n",
      "What did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.--\n",
      "She said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him\n",
      "to say more himself.  He _had_ despaired at one period; he had received\n",
      "such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed\n",
      "every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had\n",
      "perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,\n",
      "her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,\n",
      "might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;\n",
      "but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no\n",
      "farther explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\n",
      "seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,\n",
      "or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct\n",
      "is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--\n",
      "Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than\n",
      "she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.\n",
      "He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.\n",
      "He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's\n",
      "engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,\n",
      "if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest\n",
      "had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,\n",
      "on his feelings.  The delightful assurance of her total indifference\n",
      "towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged\n",
      "from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain\n",
      "her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,\n",
      "in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be\n",
      "told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior\n",
      "hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--\n",
      "The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,\n",
      "if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed\n",
      "from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like\n",
      "perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the\n",
      "same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each\n",
      "the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,\n",
      "there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,\n",
      "or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love\n",
      "with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,\n",
      "one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.\n",
      "It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from\n",
      "the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.\n",
      "He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,\n",
      "encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--\n",
      "But he had gone to a wrong place.  There was too much domestic\n",
      "happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;\n",
      "Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\n",
      "inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,\n",
      "for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\n",
      "stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's\n",
      "post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the\n",
      "gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,\n",
      "having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,\n",
      "was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\n",
      "that he could stay no longer.  He had ridden home through the rain;\n",
      "and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest\n",
      "and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,\n",
      "bore the discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\n",
      "He heard her declare that she had never loved him.  Frank Churchill's\n",
      "character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\n",
      "when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought\n",
      "of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort\n",

      "What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house\n",
      "from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope\n",
      "for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite\n",
      "flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed\n",
      "must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--\n",
      "how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen\n",
      "on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful\n",
      "effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,\n",
      "never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could\n",
      "summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,\n",
      "or even the attentive daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him\n",
      "in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\n",
      "anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he\n",
      "have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;\n",
      "but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,\n",
      "without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in\n",
      "the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably\n",
      "all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked\n",
      "on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they\n",
      "could have told him in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;\n",
      "but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised\n",
      "and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was\n",
      "the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious\n",
      "points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness\n",
      "must have some alloy.  Her father--and Harriet.  She could not be\n",
      "alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;\n",
      "and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.\n",
      "With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.\n",
      "She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short\n",
      "parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution\n",
      "of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,\n",
      "as a sin of thought.  While he lived, it must be only an engagement;\n",
      "but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\n",
      "drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--\n",
      "How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--\n",
      "how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make\n",
      "her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--\n",
      "On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--\n",
      "and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter\n",
      "reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--\n",
      "She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a\n",
      "meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;\n",
      "that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just\n",
      "now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--\n",
      "nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\n",
      "for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\n",
      "and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--\n",
      "She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited\n",
      "by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--\n",
      "At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,\n",
      "from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting\n",
      "of the evil day, when they must all be together again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment\n",
      "which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;\n",
      "and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again\n",
      "with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate\n",
      "her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have\n",
      "the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter\n",
      "was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed\n",
      "what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--\n",
      "She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted\n",
      "no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--\n",
      "and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was\n",
      "incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.  She opened\n",

      "of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting\n",

      "the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was\n",
      "perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much\n",
      "my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,\n",
      "friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\n",
      "We seemed to understand each other.  From our relative situation,\n",
      "those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss\n",
      "Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of\n",
      "that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,\n",
      "I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,\n",
      "and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no\n",
      "doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--\n",
      "She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\n",
      "have penetrated a part.  I cannot doubt it.  You will find,\n",
      "whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,\n",
      "that it did not take her wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave\n",
      "me hints of it.  I remember her telling me at the ball, that I\n",
      "owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--\n",
      "I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted\n",
      "by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.\n",
      "While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,\n",
      "I could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and procure\n",
      "for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that\n",
      "said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,\n",
      "as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--\n",
      "Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have\n",
      "now a key to.  My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get\n",
      "my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\n",
      "If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--\n",
      "Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,\n",
      "that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would\n",
      "never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--\n",
      "The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,\n",
      "my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.\n",
      "You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--\n",
      "No description can describe her.  She must tell you herself what she is--\n",
      "yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would\n",
      "so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,\n",
      "which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--\n",
      "She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,\n",
      "I dare not depend.  I want to have your opinion of her looks.\n",
      "I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\n",
      "Perhaps it is paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay;\n",
      "I am impatient for a thousand particulars.  Remember how few\n",
      "minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:\n",
      "and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness\n",
      "or misery.  When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with,\n",
      "of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad\n",
      "with joy:  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her,\n",
      "and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.\n",
      "If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.\n",
      "My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add\n",
      "to this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought to hear.\n",
      "I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,\n",
      "and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out,\n",
      "needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you\n",
      "will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,\n",
      "I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the\n",
      "very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.\n",
      "I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have\n",
      "felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--\n",
      "But I had no choice.  The hasty engagement she had entered into with\n",
      "that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,\n",
      "to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,\n",
      "and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter\n",
      "what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect\n",
      "for me.  I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners\n",
      "to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.\n",
      "_She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of\n",
      "concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;\n",
      "I thought unreasonably so:  I thought her, on a thousand occasions,\n",
      "unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:  I thought her even cold.\n",
      "But she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued\n",
      "my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\n",
      "escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\n",
      "Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\n",
      "dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.  I was late;\n",
      "I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,\n",
      "but she would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me,\n",
      "which I then thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing\n",
      "in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.\n",
      "While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one\n",
      "hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she\n",
      "to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\n",
      "every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together\n",
      "between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--\n",
      "I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.\n",
      "I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by\n",
      "such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,\n",
      "and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\n",
      "impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her\n",
      "resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--\n",
      "In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,\n",
      "abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,\n",
      "though I might have staid with you till the next morning,\n",
      "merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.  Even then,\n",
      "I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;\n",
      "but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went\n",
      "away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall\n",
      "always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.\n",
      "Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would\n",
      "ever have thought well of me again.  Its effect upon her appears\n",
      "in the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she found I\n",
      "was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\n",
      "officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,\n",
      "by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.\n",
      "I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been\n",
      "so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\n",
      "protest against the share of it which that woman has known.--\n",
      "`Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself\n",
      "in calling her by that name, even to you.  Think, then, what I must\n",
      "have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all\n",
      "the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of\n",
      "imaginary superiority.  Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--\n",
      "She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,\n",
      "and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--\n",
      "_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\n",
      "_to_ _each_:  _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This letter reached me on the very\n",
      "morning of my poor aunt's death.  I answered it within an hour;\n",
      "but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business\n",
      "falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all\n",
      "the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;\n",
      "and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,\n",
      "to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather\n",
      "disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;\n",
      "but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--\n",
      "too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;\n",
      "and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters\n",
      "all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,\n",
      "stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply\n",
      "to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\n",
      "not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both\n",
      "to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,\n",
      "she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,\n",
      "that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them\n",
      "to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period\n",
      "to her at--:  in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's,\n",
      "near Bristol, stared me in the face.  I knew the name, the place,\n",
      "I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.\n",
      "It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\n",
      "which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,\n",
      "as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive\n",
      "of its anxious delicacy.  For the world would not she have seemed\n",
      "to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually\n",
      "detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--\n",
      "What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle.\n",
      "Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--\n",
      "I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\n",
      "away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\n",
      "wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!\n",
      "with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness\n",
      "in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be\n",
      "of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must\n",
      "have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while\n",
      "all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,\n",
      "and saw how ill I had made her.  Do not pity me till I saw her wan,\n",
      "sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\n",
      "knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\n",
      "of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was\n",
      "not disappointed either in the object of my journey.  A great deal\n",
      "of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away.\n",
      "But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,\n",
      "and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.  Now, my\n",
      "dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.\n",
      "A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\n",
      "ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart\n",

      "than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me\n",

      "This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings.  She was obliged,\n",
      "in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do\n",
      "it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.  As soon as she\n",
      "came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating\n",
      "to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;\n",
      "and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,\n",
      "by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the\n",
      "very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at\n",
      "that moment.  She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;\n",
      "and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,\n",
      "yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,\n",
      "and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,\n",
      "that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,\n",
      "she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\n",
      "she desired him to read it.  She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing\n",
      "it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "had seen so much to blame in his conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be very glad to look it over,\" said he; \"but it seems long.\n",
      "I will take it home with me at night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But that would not do.  Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,\n",
      "and she must return it by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would rather be talking to you,\" he replied; \"but as it seems\n",
      "a matter of justice, it shall be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \"Had I been offered\n",
      "the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few\n",
      "months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,\n",
      "with a smile, observed, \"Humph! a fine complimentary opening:\n",
      "But it is his way.  One man's style must not be the rule of another's.\n",
      "We will not be severe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be natural for me,\" he added shortly afterwards, \"to speak my\n",
      "opinion aloud as I read.  By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\n",
      "It will not be so great a loss of time:  but if you dislike it--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.  I should wish it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He trifles here,\" said he, \"as to the temptation.  He knows\n",
      "he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought\n",
      "not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'--\n",
      "he is unjust, however, to his father.  Mr. Weston's sanguine\n",
      "temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;\n",
      "but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured\n",
      "to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I have not forgotten,\" said Emma, \"how sure you were that he\n",
      "might have come sooner if he would.  You pass it over very handsomely--\n",
      "but you were perfectly right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--\n",
      "had _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole\n",
      "of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;\n",
      "a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;\n",
      "or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,\n",
      "seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most\n",
      "dangerous game.  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--\n",
      "No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his\n",
      "own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--\n",
      "Fancying you to have fathomed his secret.  Natural enough!--\n",
      "his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it\n",
      "in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!\n",
      "My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the\n",
      "beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,\n",
      "which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had better go on,\" said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \"the pianoforte!\n",
      "Ah!  That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young\n",
      "to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much\n",
      "exceed the pleasure.  A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot\n",
      "comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection\n",
      "which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did\n",

      "\n",
      "After this, he made some progress without any pause.\n",
      "Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully\n",
      "was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I perfectly agree with you, sir,\"--was then his remark.\n",
      "\"You did behave very shamefully.  You never wrote a truer line.\"\n",
      "And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis\n",
      "of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct\n",
      "opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause\n",
      "to say, \"This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,\n",
      "for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,\n",
      "and it should have been his first object to prevent her from\n",
      "suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,\n",
      "in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.  He should have\n",
      "respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers\n",
      "were all reasonable.  We must look to her one fault, and remember\n",
      "that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,\n",
      "to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,\n",

      "It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without\n",
      "the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,\n",
      "instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance\n",
      "of Box Hill seemed to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,\n",
      "the Eltons,\" was his next observation.--\"His feelings are natural.--\n",
      "What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt\n",
      "the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--\n",

      "\"`Smallridge!'--What does this mean?  What is all this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--\n",

      "`Dearer, much dearer than ever.'  I hope he may long continue to feel\n",
      "all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,\n",
      "with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.'\n",
      "Come, he knows himself there.  `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child\n",
      "of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--\n",

      "that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.  Ever since I\n",
      "left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on\n",
      "one subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,\n",
      "such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,\n",
      "how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\n",
      "happiness of her father.  Emma's answer was ready at the first word.\n",
      "\"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\n",
      "for her.  She could never quit him.\"  Part only of this answer,\n",
      "however, was admitted.  The impossibility of her quitting her father,\n",
      "Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility\n",
      "of any other change, he could not agree to.  He had been thinking\n",
      "it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe\n",
      "it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer\n",
      "him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,\n",
      "that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort,\n",
      "perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.  Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.\n",
      "But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted\n",
      "his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\n",
      "it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as\n",
      "her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield\n",
      "to continue her home, it should be his likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own\n",
      "passing thoughts.  Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it;\n",
      "but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.\n",
      "She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.  She felt that,\n",
      "in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence\n",
      "of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,\n",
      "and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,\n",
      "to be borne with.  She promised to think of it, and advised him\n",
      "to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection\n",
      "could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.  He had\n",
      "given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;\n",
      "he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,\n",
      "to have his thoughts to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\" cried Emma.  \"I am\n",
      "sure William Larkins will not like it.  You must get his consent\n",
      "before you ask mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,\n",
      "to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view\n",
      "in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\n",
      "struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights\n",
      "as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.\n",
      "Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;\n",
      "and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,\n",
      "and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent\n",
      "dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,\n",
      "which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of\n",
      "the sister and the aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--\n",
      "the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\n",
      "His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,\n",
      "their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.  Such a companion\n",
      "for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--\n",
      "Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be\n",
      "giving increase of melancholy!\n",
      "\n",
      "She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every\n",
      "blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings\n",
      "of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.\n",
      "The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,\n",
      "poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a\n",
      "distance from.  She would be a loser in every way.  Emma could not\n",
      "deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.\n",
      "In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;\n",
      "but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\n",
      "that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\n",
      "supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--\n",
      "not like Mr. Elton.  Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,\n",
      "so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be\n",
      "less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even\n",
      "of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men\n",
      "in one year.\n",

      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous\n",
      "as herself to avoid a meeting.  Their intercourse was painful\n",
      "enough by letter.  How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,\n",
      "without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied\n",
      "there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\n",
      "her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\n",
      "It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\n",
      "angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\n",
      "and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\n",
      "without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\n",
      "Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.\n",
      "Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill\n",
      "health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a\n",
      "dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet\n",
      "under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,\n",
      "Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--\n",
      "Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\n",
      "to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,\n",
      "it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she\n",
      "could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by\n",
      "that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,\n",
      "which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\n",
      "near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,\n",
      "be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps\n",
      "an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not\n",
      "think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\n",
      "which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\n",
      "in her mind which Harriet had occupied.  There was a communication\n",
      "before her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--\n",
      "the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would\n",
      "have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer\n",
      "the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.  No additional\n",
      "agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--\n",
      "and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\n",
      "appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,\n",
      "to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half\n",
      "an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--\n",
      "She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of\n",
      "their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.\n",
      "It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a\n",
      "similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\n",
      "which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had\n",
      "not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor\n",
      "Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,\n",
      "though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--\n",
      "The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured\n",
      "of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--\n",
      "She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor\n",
      "Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard\n",
      "nothing but the instant reply of, \"Beg her to walk up;\"--and a moment\n",
      "afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly\n",
      "forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--\n",
      "Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.\n",
      "There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every\n",
      "thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\n",
      "She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\n",
      "feeling tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible\n",
      "for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being\n",
      "so entirely without words.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,\n",
      "if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not\n",
      "checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\n",
      "and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest\n",
      "shake of the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.  Miss Bates was out,\n",
      "which accounted for the previous tranquillity.  Emma could have\n",
      "wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience\n",
      "with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,\n",
      "she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,\n",
      "and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;\n",
      "it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself\n",
      "acquainted with what was still a secret to other people.\n",
      "Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;\n",
      "and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing\n",
      "to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort\n",
      "of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\n",
      "been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple\n",
      "and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can finish this some other time, you know.  You and I shall\n",
      "not want opportunities.  And, in fact, you have heard all the\n",
      "essential already.  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits\n",
      "our apology, and is not offended.  You see how delightfully\n",
      "she writes.  Oh! she is a sweet creature!  You would have doated\n",
      "on her, had you gone.--But not a word more.  Let us be discreet--\n",
      "quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--\n",
      "I forget the poem at this moment:\n",
      "\n",
      "        \"For when a lady's in the case,\n",
      "        \"You know all other things give place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word\n",
      "to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?  But I want\n",
      "to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see,\n",
      "has quite appeased her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look\n",
      "at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as\n",
      "a minister of state.  I managed it extremely well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every\n",
      "possible occasion.  When they had all talked a little while in harmony\n",
      "of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\n",
      "charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the\n",
      "highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)\n",
      "Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--\n",
      "Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\"--\n",
      "And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,\n",
      "\"We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have;\n",
      "not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;\n",
      "Perry shall have all the credit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\"\n",
      "she shortly afterwards began, \"since the party to Box Hill.\n",
      "Very pleasant party.  But yet I think there was something wanting.\n",
      "Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon\n",
      "the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might\n",
      "be mistaken.  However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one\n",
      "to go again.  What say you both to our collecting the same party,\n",
      "and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--\n",
      "It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,\n",
      "not _one_ exception.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted\n",
      "by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,\n",
      "from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\n",
      "to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--\n",
      "that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--\n",
      "How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--\n",
      "Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--\n",
      "Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--\n",
      "such attention to Jane!\"--And from her great, her more than commonly\n",
      "thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed\n",
      "that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,\n",
      "from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--\n",
      "After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,\n",
      "Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,\n",
      "that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;\n",
      "but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.\n",
      "He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--\n",
      "That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like\n",
      "morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning\n",
      "to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence\n",
      "or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,\n",
      "are always wanting his opinion.  They seem not able to do any thing\n",
      "without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.--\n",
      "I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,\n",
      "if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I\n",
      "absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe\n",
      "I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,\n",
      "I assure you:  yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.\"  And putting\n",
      "up her hand to screen her words from Emma--\"A congratulatory visit,\n",
      "you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\n",
      "from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together\n",
      "in deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \"Is Mr. Elton\n",
      "gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.\n",
      "Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only\n",
      "of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing\n",
      "their own way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have not you mistaken the day?\" said Emma.  \"I am almost certain\n",
      "that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley\n",
      "was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\" was the abrupt answer,\n",
      "which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--\n",
      "\"I do believe,\" she continued, \"this is the most troublesome parish\n",
      "that ever was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your parish there was small,\" said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\n",
      "talked of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\n",
      "you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;\n",
      "the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true.  What a thinking brain\n",
      "you have!  I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make,\n",
      "if we could be shaken together.  My liveliness and your solidity\n",
      "would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,\n",
      "that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--\n",
      "not a word, if you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\n",
      "not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\n",
      "The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,\n",
      "was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some\n",
      "of her sparkling vivacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\n",
      "encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--\n",
      "But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.\n",
      "You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--\n",
      "Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies\n",
      "a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,\n",
      "how soon it may be wanted?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\n",
      "His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\n",
      "object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,\n",
      "and the walk he had had for nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found.\n",
      "Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,\n",
      "and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home\n",
      "till one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Donwell!\" cried his wife.--\"My dear Mr. E., you have not been\n",
      "to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\n",
      "to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--\n",
      "I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)\n",
      "which made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home!\n",
      "I assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message\n",
      "for me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--\n",
      "Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.\n",
      "Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--\n",
      "Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you\n",
      "explain it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\n",
      "indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot imagine,\" said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\n",
      "ought to do,) \"I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,\n",
      "of all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect\n",
      "to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,\n",
      "I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--\n",
      "and his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case:\n",
      "and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,\n",
      "I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I\n",
      "would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard\n",
      "for any consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds\n",
      "her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never\n",
      "sent it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I met William Larkins,\" continued Mr. Elton, \"as I got near\n",
      "the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,\n",
      "but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.\n",
      "He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he\n",
      "could hardly ever get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with\n",
      "William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that _I_\n",
      "should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,\n",
      "of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk\n",
      "to no purpose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.\n",
      "In all probability she was at this very time waited for there;\n",
      "and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression\n",
      "towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined\n",
      "to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;\n",
      "it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,\n",
      "to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.\n",
      "Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been\n",
      "tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more\n",
      "openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should\n",
      "certainly have been impertinent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\n",
      "infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her\n",
      "usual composure--\"there would have been no danger.  The danger\n",
      "would have been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified\n",
      "me more than by expressing an interest--.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
      "(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I\n",
      "have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly\n",
      "consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good\n",
      "opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a\n",
      "degree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say.\n",
      "I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.\n",
      "I feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately--in short, if your\n",
      "compassion does not stand my friend--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\" cried Emma warmly,\n",
      "and taking her hand.  \"You owe me no apologies; and every body to\n",
      "whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,\n",
      "so delighted even--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--\n",
      "So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life\n",
      "of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray say no more.  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\n",
      "Let us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be\n",
      "done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.\n",
      "I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--\n",
      "just as I begin to know you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.\n",
      "I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\" replied Emma,\n",
      "smiling--\"but, excuse me, it must be thought of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The smile was returned as Jane answered,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very right; it has been thought of.  And I will own\n",
      "to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living\n",
      "with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.  There must be\n",
      "three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,\n",
      "I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--\n",

      "Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety;\n",
      "and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased\n",
      "to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.\n",
      "She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.  She would\n",
      "not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match\n",
      "for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was\n",
      "convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.\n",
      "It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--\n",
      "and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have\n",
      "his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\n",
      "and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--\n",
      "no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it\n",
      "would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,\n",
      "should not have their powers in exercise again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\"\n",
      "she continued--\"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis,\n",
      "in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see\n",
      "her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is,\" replied Mr. Knightley, \"she will indulge her even more\n",
      "than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.\n",
      "It will be the only difference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor child!\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable\n",
      "in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.  I am losing\n",
      "all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.\n",
      "I, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible\n",
      "ingratitude in me to be severe on them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma laughed, and replied:  \"But I had the assistance of all\n",
      "your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.\n",
      "I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:--\n",
      "Miss Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well.\n",
      "My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was\n",
      "very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--\n",
      "and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done\n",
      "in a disagreeable manner.  I do not believe I did you any good.\n",
      "The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest\n",
      "affection to me.  I could not think about you so much without doating\n",
      "on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\n",
      "have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure you were of use to me,\" cried Emma.  \"I was very often\n",
      "influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.\n",
      "I am very sure you did me good.  And if poor little Anna Weston is\n",
      "to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much\n",
      "for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her\n",
      "when she is thirteen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one\n",
      "of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;\n",
      "papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which,\n",
      "you knew, I did not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving\n",
      "you two bad feelings instead of one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold\n",
      "my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,\n",
      "from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.\n",
      "I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,\n",
      "about ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you;\n",
      "but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And cannot you call me `George' now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'\n",
      "I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,\" she added presently,\n",
      "laughing and blushing--\"I will promise to call you once by your\n",
      "Christian name.  I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess\n",
      "where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one\n",
      "important service which his better sense would have rendered her,\n",
      "to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all\n",
      "her womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;\n",
      "but it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--\n",
      "Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them.  This, on his side,\n",
      "might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma\n",
      "was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,\n",
      "from some appearances, that their friendship were declining.\n",
      "She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,\n",
      "they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her\n",
      "intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,\n",
      "on Isabella's letters.  He might observe that it was so.  The pain\n",
      "of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little\n",
      "inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could\n",
      "be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\n",
      "which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to\n",
      "be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not\n",
      "appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--\n",
      "Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet\n",
      "had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have\n",
      "escaped her.  Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on,\n",
      "by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be\n",
      "a month at least.  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down\n",
      "in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley.\n",
      "\"Here is his answer, if you like to see it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.\n",
      "Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive\n",
      "to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing\n",
      "that her friend was unmentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John enters like a brother into my happiness,\" continued Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "\"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\n",
      "likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from\n",
      "making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\n",
      "cool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read\n",
      "the letter.  \"I honour his sincerity.  It is very plain that he\n",
      "considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,\n",
      "but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy\n",
      "of your affection, as you think me already.  Had he said any thing\n",
      "to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Emma, he means no such thing.  He only means--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\"\n",
      "interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\"much less, perhaps,\n",
      "than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve\n",
      "on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma, my dear Emma--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" she cried with more thorough gaiety, \"if you fancy your\n",
      "brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in\n",
      "the secret, and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much\n",
      "farther from doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness,\n",
      "all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit\n",
      "on mine.  I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.--\n",
      "His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" he cried, \"I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\n",
      "as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\n",
      "to be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John's letter--\n",
      "did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take\n",
      "him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing\n",
      "something of the kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\n",
      "some thoughts of marrying.  He had no idea of me.  He seems perfectly\n",
      "unprepared for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into\n",
      "my feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious\n",
      "of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare\n",
      "him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--\n",
      "But it was so, I suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I\n",
      "was staying with them the other day.  I believe I did not play\n",
      "with the children quite so much as usual.  I remember one evening\n",
      "the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'\n",
      "reception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\n",
      "recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view\n",
      "that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,\n",
      "resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--\n",
      "But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself\n",
      "to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it\n",
      "came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must\n",
      "have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,\n",
      "and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced\n",
      "to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.  She must not make it a more\n",
      "decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\n",
      "She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits\n",
      "she could command, she prepared him first for something strange,\n",
      "and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation\n",
      "could be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with\n",
      "no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--\n",
      "she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield\n",
      "would receive the constant addition of that person's company\n",
      "whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,\n",
      "best in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\n",
      "earnestly to dissuade her from it.  She was reminded, more than once,\n",
      "of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it\n",
      "would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of\n",
      "poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung\n",
      "about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that\n",
      "he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\n",
      "taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:\n",
      "but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;\n",
      "she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but\n",
      "for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal\n",
      "the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once\n",
      "got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--\n",
      "He would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want\n",
      "to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,\n",
      "who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--\n",
      "Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he\n",
      "like to have him always on the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true.\n",
      "Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see\n",
      "him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could\n",
      "not they go on as they had done?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\n",
      "the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--\n",
      "To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,\n",
      "whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;\n",
      "and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--\n",
      "They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters\n",
      "of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,\n",
      "on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most\n",
      "serviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--\n",
      "well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\n",
      "to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;\n",
      "and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\n",
      "it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself\n",
      "which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--\n",
      "in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad\n",
      "if the marriage did take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\n",
      "said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\n",
      "never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;\n",
      "but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had\n",
      "no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard\n",
      "for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;\n",
      "and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable\n",
      "a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,\n",
      "so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed\n",
      "as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,\n",
      "and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\n",
      "thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men\n",
      "in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own\n",
      "home for Hartfield!  And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear\n",
      "with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--\n",
      "The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always\n",
      "felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank\n",
      "and Emma.  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had\n",
      "been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than\n",
      "by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject\n",
      "better than by saying--\"Those matters will take care of themselves;\n",
      "the young people will find a way.\"  But here there was nothing to be\n",
      "shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.  It was all right,\n",
      "all open, all equal.  No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\n",
      "It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,\n",
      "and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\n",
      "as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing\n",
      "could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would\n",
      "soon have outgrown its first set of caps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;\n",
      "and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes\n",
      "were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--\n",
      "He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all\n",
      "the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;\n",
      "and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he\n",
      "had always foreseen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is to be a secret, I conclude,\" said he.  \"These matters are\n",
      "always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.\n",

      "any suspicion.\"\n",

      "He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on\n",
      "that point.  He told her the news.  Was not she like a daughter,\n",
      "his eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,\n",
      "it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,\n",
      "immediately afterwards.  It was no more than the principals were\n",
      "prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known\n",
      "at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking\n",
      "of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,\n",
      "with great sagacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, it was a very well approved match.  Some might think him,\n",
      "and others might think her, the most in luck.  One set might\n",
      "recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield\n",
      "for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements\n",
      "among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious\n",
      "objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,\n",
      "the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton\n",
      "cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the\n",
      "young lady's pride would now be contented;\" and supposed \"she had\n",
      "always meant to catch Knightley if she could;\" and, on the point\n",
      "of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \"Rather he than I!\"--\n",
      "But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\"Poor Knightley!\n",
      "poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;\n",
      "for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--\n",
      "How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--\n",
      "not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\n",
      "pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\n",
      "with them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--\n",
      "Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_.\n",
      "Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on\n",
      "every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry\n",
      "that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,\n",
      "living together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple\n",
      "Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end\n",
      "of the first quarter.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed on.  A few more to-morrows, and the party from London\n",
      "would be arriving.  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking\n",
      "of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\n",
      "grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts\n",
      "were put by.  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;\n",
      "and then, in a graver tone, began with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good or bad?\" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know which it ought to be called.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.  You are trying\n",
      "not to smile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid,\" said he, composing his features, \"I am very much afraid,\n",
      "my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which\n",
      "pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is one subject,\" he replied, \"I hope but one, on which\n",
      "we do not think alike.\"  He paused a moment, again smiling,\n",
      "with his eyes fixed on her face.  \"Does nothing occur to you?--\n",
      "Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\n",
      "though she knew not what.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?\" cried he.\n",
      "\"You have, I believe, and know the whole.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.\n",
      "Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--\n",
      "and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\"\n",
      "but her lips were closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is so, indeed,\" continued Mr. Knightley; \"I have it from Robert\n",
      "Martin himself.  He left me not half an hour ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\n",
      "the same.  But in time they will.  Time, you may be sure, will make\n",
      "one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,\n",
      "we need not talk much on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\" she replied, exerting herself.\n",
      "\"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,\n",
      "but I cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean\n",
      "to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot\n",
      "mean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean,\n",
      "that he intends it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean that he has done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling\n",
      "but determined decision, \"and been accepted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" she cried.--\"Well!\"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\n",
      "in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the\n",
      "exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\n",
      "must be expressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing;\n",
      "make this intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.\n",
      "I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,\n",
      "I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days ago,\n",
      "and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting\n",
      "to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,\n",
      "and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.\n",
      "They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party\n",
      "was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.\n",
      "My friend Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way;\n",
      "were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with\n",
      "them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit\n",
      "(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;\n",
      "and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,\n",
      "as happy even as he is deserving.  He came down by yesterday's coach,\n",
      "and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report\n",
      "his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.\n",
      "This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.\n",
      "Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--\n",
      "She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's\n",
      "language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only\n",
      "in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed\n",
      "for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did mention,\n",
      "without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\n",
      "box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley\n",
      "and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\n",
      "and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\n",
      "rather uneasy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak,\n",
      "she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\n",
      "of happiness.  She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.\n",
      "Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,\n",
      "he added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make\n",
      "you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.\n",
      "His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies\n",
      "your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better\n",
      "of him as you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would\n",
      "delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your\n",
      "friend in better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could,\n",
      "which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me\n",
      "about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself\n",
      "not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think\n",
      "Harriet is doing extremely well.  _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_.\n",
      "In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.\n",
      "I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.\n",
      "You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\n",
      "unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more\n",
      "determined against him, much more, than she was before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley;\n",
      "\"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,\n",
      "not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told\n",
      "her he loved her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word,\n",
      "I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\n",
      "_accepted_ him.  I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--\n",
      "Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;\n",
      "of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,\n",
      "in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not\n",
      "Harriet's hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some\n",
      "famous ox.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\n",
      "Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings,\n",
      "and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\n",
      "passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words,\n",
      "spoken with such emphasis, \"No, I hope I know better than to think\n",
      "of Robert Martin,\" that she was really expecting the intelligence\n",
      "to prove, in some measure, premature.  It could not be otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you dare say this?\" cried Mr. Knightley.  \"Do you dare to suppose\n",
      "me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--\n",
      "What do you deserve?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!  I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put\n",
      "up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,\n",
      "direct answer.  Are you quite sure that you understand the terms\n",
      "on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he\n",
      "told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,\n",
      "nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you\n",
      "a proof that it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he\n",
      "was now to do.  He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he\n",
      "could apply for information of her relations or friends.  Could I\n",
      "mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?\n",
      "I assured him that I could not.  Then, he said, he would endeavour\n",
      "to see her in the course of this day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\n",
      "\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\n",
      "Harriet's good qualities.  I have taken some pains for your sake,\n",
      "and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe\n",
      "as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.\n",
      "I have often talked to her a good deal.  You must have seen that\n",
      "I did.  Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me\n",
      "of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all\n",
      "my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\n",
      "with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing\n",
      "her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--\n",
      "Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!\" cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah! poor Harriet!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little\n",
      "more praise than she deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\n",
      "her father.  She was not sorry.  She wanted to be alone.  Her mind\n",
      "was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her\n",
      "to be collected.  She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;\n",
      "and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed\n",
      "and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put\n",
      "the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;\n",
      "and she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations\n",
      "may be imagined.  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\n",
      "prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming\n",
      "too happy for security.--What had she to wish for?  Nothing, but to\n",
      "grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been\n",
      "ever so superior to her own.  Nothing, but that the lessons\n",
      "of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;\n",
      "and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst\n",
      "of them.  She must laugh at such a close!  Such an end of the doleful\n",
      "disappointment of five weeks back!  Such a heart--such a Harriet!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would\n",
      "be a pleasure.  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\n",
      "\n",
      "High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,\n",
      "was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\n",
      "Mr. Knightley would soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation,\n",
      "mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.\n",
      "She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\n",
      "confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;\n",
      "not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;\n",
      "and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable\n",
      "persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,\n",
      "or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--\n",
      "but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse\n",
      "received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse\n",
      "was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.  \"I was just\n",
      "going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\n",
      "this morning.  He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been\n",
      "persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In half a minute they were in the room.  Emma was extremely glad\n",
      "to see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of\n",
      "embarrassing recollections on each side.  They met readily and smiling,\n",
      "but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;\n",
      "and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank\n",
      "in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,\n",
      "which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,\n",
      "and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.\n",
      "When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby\n",
      "was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--\n",
      "or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her\n",
      "and say,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving\n",
      "message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.  I hope time has not made\n",
      "you less willing to pardon.  I hope you do not retract what you\n",
      "then said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.\n",
      "I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give\n",
      "you joy in person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\n",
      "with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not she looking well?\" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n",
      "\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and\n",
      "Mrs. Weston doat upon her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,\n",
      "after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named\n",
      "the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced\n",
      "in her hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it\n",
      "possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.  Early, I know,\n",
      "you had none.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I had--\n",
      "it would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong things,\n",
      "they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--\n",
      "It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond\n",
      "of secrecy and told you every thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle's being persuaded\n",
      "to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.\n",
      "When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,\n",
      "and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,\n",
      "I am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--\n",
      "Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.\n",
      "Do not you pity me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession\n",
      "of gay thought, he cried,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for\n",
      "the moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\"  He paused.--She coloured\n",
      "and laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember\n",
      "my wish in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.--\n",
      "I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest\n",
      "and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;\n",
      "but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\n",
      "own Jane, and his next words were,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--\n",
      "and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.\n",
      "It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--\n",
      "a most distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.--\n",
      "Just colour enough for beauty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do not\n",
      "I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--\n",
      "When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could\n",
      "not help saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,\n",

      "A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no\n",
      "sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,\n",

      "that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\n",
      "and was now forming all her views of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\n",
      "but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,\n",
      "and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die\n",
      "away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\n",
      "and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\n",
      "her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of\n",
      "that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--\n",
      "Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\n",
      "Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all\n",
      "with the utmost delight.  But what did such particulars explain?--\n",
      "The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had\n",
      "always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had\n",
      "been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible\n",
      "to Emma.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her\n",
      "fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.\n",
      "She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford\n",
      "her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent\n",
      "enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood\n",
      "of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--\n",

      "of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,\n",
      "and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,\n",
      "of security, stability, and improvement.  She would be placed in the\n",
      "midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;\n",
      "retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.\n",
      "She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.\n",
      "She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be\n",
      "the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and\n",

      "change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought\n",

      "before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she\n",
      "scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the\n",

      "marriage but as a distant event.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they\n",
      "were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--\n",
      "He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--\n",
      "a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.\n",
      "Still, however, he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,\n",

      "of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm\n",
      "every night of his life.  The strength, resolution, and presence\n",
      "of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.\n",
      "While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--\n",

      "to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within\n",
      "the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again take up\n",
      "the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\n",
      "but now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of\n",
      "her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\n",

      "open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,\n",
      "and pushed it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,\n",
      "and especially the history of her own family, must ever present\n",
      "the remembrance of.  The heir presumptive, the very William Walter\n",
      "Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported\n",
      "by her father, had disappointed her.\n",

      "She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\n",
      "in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,\n",
      "meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.\n",
      "He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death,\n",
      "Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures\n",
      "had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,\n",
      "making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of\n",
      "their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,\n",
      "Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law;\n",
      "and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour\n",
      "was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of\n",
      "and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.\n",
      "The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\n",
      "again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;\n",
      "and the next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing\n",
      "his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,\n",
      "he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman\n",
      "of inferior birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter has resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that\n",
      "he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man\n",
      "so publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\"\n",
      "he observed, \"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of\n",
      "the House of Commons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed,\n",
      "but apparently very little regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology,\n",
      "and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,\n",
      "as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between\n",
      "them had ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval\n",
      "of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man\n",
      "for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose\n",
      "strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\n",
      "Elliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom\n",
      "her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.\n",
      "Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was\n",
      "at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons\n",
      "for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.\n",
      "The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was\n",
      "no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,\n",
      "had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention\n",
      "of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully\n",
      "of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood\n",
      "he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.\n",
      "This could not be pardoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares\n",
      "to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,\n",
      "the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;\n",
      "such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence\n",
      "in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits\n",
      "of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\n",
      "added to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.\n",
      "She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive\n",
      "the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of\n",
      "Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was good,\n",
      "but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required\n",
      "in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\n",
      "moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;\n",
      "but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period\n",
      "he had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible\n",
      "for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot\n",
      "was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was\n",
      "not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,\n",
      "that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,\n",
      "from his daughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring\n",
      "in town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?\n",
      "Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which\n",
      "we can retrench?\" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first\n",
      "ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,\n",
      "and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off\n",
      "some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing\n",
      "the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added\n",
      "the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,\n",
      "as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these measures,\n",
      "however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent\n",
      "of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\n",
      "to confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose\n",
      "of deeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,\n",
      "as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise\n",
      "any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,\n",
      "or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of;\n",
      "but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.\n",
      "He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,\n",
      "but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never disgrace\n",
      "his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\n",

      "rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;\n",
      "she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little\n",

      "They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was\n",

      "and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne,\n",
      "who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\n",
      "in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her\n",
      "in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\n",
      "to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of\n",
      "honesty against importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures,\n",

      "these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope\n",
      "we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has\n",
      "a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;\n",
      "and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from\n",
      "lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.\n",
      "What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families\n",
      "have done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case;\n",
      "and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,\n",
      "as it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.\n",
      "We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who\n",
      "has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to\n",

      "all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\n",
      "could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.\n",

      "of life knocked off!  Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--\n",
      "contractions and restrictions every where!  To live no longer\n",

      "and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\n",
      "a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter\n",
      "which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in confessing\n",
      "his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not appear to him\n",
      "that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\n",
      "which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.\n",
      "In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would\n",
      "be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\n",
      "he might choose to model his household.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more\n",
      "of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go\n",
      "was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house\n",
      "in the country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.\n",
      "A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have\n",
      "Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure\n",
      "of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object\n",
      "of her ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her,\n",
      "in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.\n",
      "She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;\n",
      "and Bath was to be her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\n",
      "that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough\n",
      "to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\n",
      "place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\n",
      "at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath\n",
      "over London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\n",
      "distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending\n",
      "some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction\n",
      "of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been\n",
      "for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that\n",
      "they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.\n",
      "It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house\n",
      "in his own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found\n",
      "the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's\n",
      "feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's\n",
      "dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\n",
      "first, from the circumstance of her having been three years\n",
      "at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly,\n",
      "from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\n",
      "which she had afterwards spent there with herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think\n",
      "it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health,\n",
      "by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,\n",
      "every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must\n",
      "do both health and spirits good.  Anne had been too little from home,\n",
      "too little seen. Her spirits were not high.  A larger society\n",
      "would improve them.  She wanted her to be more known.\n",
      "\n",
      "The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\n",
      "for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,\n",
      "and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily\n",
      "engrafted on the beginning.  He was not only to quit his home,\n",
      "but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,\n",
      "which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.\n",
      "Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This, however, was a profound secret,\n",
      "not to be breathed beyond their own circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\n",
      "to design letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\n",

      "the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\n",
      "being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on\n",
      "the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\n",
      "unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\n",
      "that he would let it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell had\n",
      "another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter\n",
      "and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had been\n",
      "lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\n",
      "It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,\n",
      "after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with\n",
      "the additional burden of two children.  She was a clever young woman,\n",
      "who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,\n",
      "at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,\n",
      "as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all\n",
      "that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,\n",
      "could hint of caution and reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,\n",
      "and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,\n",
      "than because Elizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more\n",
      "than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;\n",
      "had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,\n",
      "against previous inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest\n",
      "in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open\n",
      "to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\n",
      "which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\n",
      "to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;\n",
      "but always in vain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she\n",
      "pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in\n",
      "this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving\n",

      "From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal,\n",

      "said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven her over,\n",
      "nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch:\n",
      "\"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\n",
      "a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the profession;\n",
      "and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful\n",
      "in all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,\n",
      "if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in\n",
      "and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!\n",
      "The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\n",
      "as they are now.  You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own\n",
      "sweet flower gardens being neglected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced\n",
      "to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\n",
      "to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.\n",
      "The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,\n",
      "or men of any other description, can have had such a range;\n",
      "but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,\n",
      "is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\n",
      "always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard\n",
      "with respect to her flower garden.  I am very little disposed\n",
      "to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,\n",
      "I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In all these cases, there are established usages which\n",
      "make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.\n",
      "Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me\n",
      "for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.\n",
      "I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous\n",
      "for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Anne spoke--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least\n",
      "an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and\n",
      "all the privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough\n",
      "for their comforts, we must all allow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,\"\n",
      "was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and \"Oh! certainly,\" was his daughter's;\n",
      "but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see\n",
      "any friend of mine belonging to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds\n",
      "of objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons\n",
      "of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours\n",
      "which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,\n",
      "as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old\n",
      "sooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.\n",
      "A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\n",
      "of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,\n",
      "and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in\n",
      "any other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company\n",
      "with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;\n",
      "Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,\n",
      "without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,\n",
      "and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage\n",
      "you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged\n",
      "to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,\n",
      "and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  `In the name of heaven,\n",
      "who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near,\n",
      "(Sir Basil Morley).  `Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral Baldwin.\n",
      "What do you take his age to be?'  `Sixty,' said I, `or perhaps sixty-two.'\n",
      "`Forty,' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves\n",
      "my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.\n",
      "I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do;\n",
      "but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all\n",
      "knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,\n",
      "till they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked\n",
      "on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Sir Walter,\" cried Mrs Clay, \"this is being severe indeed.\n",
      "Have a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.\n",
      "The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;\n",
      "I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then,\n",
      "is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?\n",
      "Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in\n",
      "the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,\n",
      "if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural\n",
      "effect of time.  The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician\n",
      "is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even\n",
      "the clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might\n",
      "do for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged\n",
      "to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to\n",
      "all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In fact, as I have\n",
      "long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable\n",
      "in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any,\n",
      "who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,\n",
      "following their own pursuits, and living on their own property,\n",
      "without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,\n",
      "to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:\n",
      "I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\n",
      "when they cease to be quite young.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak\n",
      "Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant,\n",
      "had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application\n",
      "for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards\n",
      "fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed,\n",
      "he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.\n",
      "By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,\n",
      "Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired\n",
      "a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,\n",
      "and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places\n",
      "in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;\n",
      "that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,\n",
      "Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a secret,)--\n",
      "accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,\n",
      "and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner,\n",
      "he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,\n",
      "and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong\n",
      "an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\n",
      "could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,\n",
      "every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family,\n",
      "and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,\n",
      "added--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,\n",
      "and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,\n",
      "I believe, several years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I take it for granted,\" observed Sir Walter, \"that his face\n",
      "is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,\n",
      "hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,\n",
      "but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;\n",
      "not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted\n",
      "a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;\n",
      "knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished\n",
      "house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised\n",
      "if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;\n",
      "would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it;\n",
      "said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all\n",
      "the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him\n",
      "peculiarly desirable as a tenant.  He was a married man,\n",
      "and without children; the very state to be wished for.  A house was\n",
      "never taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:\n",
      "he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\n",
      "as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.\n",
      "A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture\n",
      "in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton\n",
      "with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were\n",
      "talking the matter over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,\"\n",
      "continued he; \"asked more questions about the house, and terms,\n",
      "and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant\n",
      "with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite\n",
      "unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,\n",
      "she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;\n",
      "she told me so herself:  sister to the gentleman who lived\n",
      "a few years back at Monkford.  Bless me! what was his name?\n",
      "At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.\n",
      "Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman\n",
      "who lived at Monkford:  Mrs Croft's brother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not\n",
      "hear the appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember\n",
      "no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.\n",
      "A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman\n",
      "so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,\n",
      "I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man\n",
      "breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;\n",
      "caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,\n",
      "submitted to an amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting another moment--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.\n",
      "He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,\n",
      "for two or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.\n",
      "You remember him, I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.\n",
      "You misled me by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of\n",
      "some man of property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;\n",
      "quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.\n",
      "One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them\n",
      "no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,\n",
      "with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\n",
      "in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea\n",
      "they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for\n",
      "the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked\n",
      "nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:\n",
      "an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in\n",
      "the secret of Sir Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with\n",
      "an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them\n",
      "infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms,\n",
      "he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,\n",
      "and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained\n",
      "at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough\n",
      "of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,\n",
      "in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.\n",
      "So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little\n",
      "additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just\n",
      "high enough, and not too high.  \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\"\n",
      "would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;\n",
      "a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs\n",
      "a note of explanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence,\n",
      "and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.\n",
      "In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever\n",
      "have the precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:\n",
      "but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,\n",

      "and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had\n",
      "such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener\n",
      "to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her\n",
      "flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,\n",

      "off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,\n",
      "in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home\n",
      "for half a year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine\n",
      "young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;\n",
      "and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,\n",
      "and feeling.  Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have\n",

      "the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,\n",
      "and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.\n",

      "Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,\n",

      "to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances\n",
      "of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure\n",
      "even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away,\n",

      "He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.\n",
      "Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in\n",

      "and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.\n",
      "She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a\n",
      "dangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.\n",

      "be continually advising her in vain.  She was persuaded to believe\n",
      "the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet, improper, hardly capable\n",
      "of success, and not deserving it.  But it was not a merely selfish caution,\n",
      "under which she acted, in putting an end to it.  Had she not\n",

      "to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found\n",
      "a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had\n",

      "to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such\n",
      "certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.\n",
      "She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home,\n",
      "and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,\n",
      "delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman\n",
      "in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;\n",
      "and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than\n",

      "without reference to the actual results of their case, which,\n",
      "as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\n",
      "could be reasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations,\n",
      "all his confidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour\n",
      "had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.\n",
      "He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:\n",
      "and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.\n",
      "He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,\n",
      "and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.\n",
      "She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,\n",
      "but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,\n",
      "she had no reason to believe him married.\n",

      "How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,\n",
      "were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful\n",
      "confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which\n",
      "seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced\n",
      "into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:\n",
      "the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,\n",
      "she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely\n",
      "to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,\n",
      "and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.\n",
      "She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves\n",
      "sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts\n",
      "and their business no evil.  She was assisted, however, by that\n",
      "perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three\n",
      "of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny\n",
      "any recollection of it.  She could do justice to the superiority\n",
      "of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;\n",
      "she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;\n",
      "but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\n",
      "from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really\n",
      "taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\n",
      "had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to\n",
      "those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,\n",
      "she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,\n",
      "the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received\n",
      "any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother had been\n",
      "long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,\n",
      "a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's\n",

      "The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying\n",
      "her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,\n",
      "had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by\n",
      "the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge\n",
      "of it afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\n",
      "and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,\n",

      "On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch Hall,\n",
      "Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's,\n",
      "and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural\n",
      "to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,\n",
      "and decided the whole business at once.  Each lady was previously\n",
      "well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,\n",
      "but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,\n",
      "there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality\n",
      "on the Admiral's side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,\n",
      "who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\n",
      "behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report,\n",
      "to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts\n",
      "were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;\n",
      "and Mr Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been\n",
      "a single preliminary difference to modify of all that\n",
      "\"This indenture sheweth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be\n",
      "the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,\n",
      "that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,\n",
      "he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;\n",
      "and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife\n",
      "as they drove back through the park, \"I thought we should soon\n",
      "come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.\n",
      "The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be\n",
      "no harm in him.\"  reciprocal compliments, which would have been\n",
      "esteemed about equal.\n",

      "The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter\n",
      "proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,\n",
      "there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use,\n",
      "or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were\n",
      "going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,\n",
      "and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\n",
      "convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements\n",
      "of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,\n",
      "she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne\n",
      "though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare\n",
      "of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\n",
      "of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,\n",
      "everything considered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right,\n",
      "and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering\n",
      "to go with the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.\n",
      "Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal\n",
      "of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne\n",
      "when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing\n",
      "that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated,\n",
      "or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to\n",
      "Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her,\n",
      "instead of going to Bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary's reasoning;\n",
      "and Elizabeth's reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay,\n",
      "for nobody will want her in Bath.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least\n",
      "better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to\n",
      "be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,\n",
      "and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,\n",
      "and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties,\n",
      "and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath\n",
      "till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time\n",
      "should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled\n",
      "by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,\n",
      "which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter\n",
      "and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\n",
      "in all the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry\n",
      "that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,\n",
      "grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,\n",
      "in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,\n",
      "was a very sore aggravation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt\n",
      "the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.\n",
      "With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,\n",
      "which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was\n",
      "sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\n",
      "were more than possible.  She did not imagine that her father\n",
      "had at present an idea of the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles,\n",
      "and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually\n",
      "making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,\n",
      "and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind\n",
      "and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions\n",
      "than any merely personal might have been.  Anne was so impressed\n",
      "by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself\n",
      "from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.  She had little hope\n",
      "of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be\n",
      "so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,\n",
      "have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive\n",
      "how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly\n",
      "answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is;\n",
      "and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be,\n",
      "I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are\n",
      "particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\n",
      "and rank more strongly than most people.  And as to my father,\n",
      "I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single\n",
      "so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were\n",
      "a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her\n",
      "so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,\n",
      "would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might\n",
      "be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,\n",
      "can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor\n",
      "Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.  One would imagine\n",
      "you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,\n",
      "though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth of her's\n",
      "and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much\n",
      "as they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few,\n",
      "but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice\n",
      "Mrs Clay's freckles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne,\n",
      "\"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly;\n",
      "\"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never\n",
      "alter plain ones.  However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more\n",
      "at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it\n",
      "rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless\n",
      "of doing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,\n",
      "might yet be made observant by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,\n",
      "Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.  The party drove off in very good spirits;\n",
      "Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\n",
      "tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves,\n",
      "and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity,\n",
      "to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt this\n",
      "break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was\n",
      "as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become\n",
      "precious by habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds,\n",
      "and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;\n",
      "and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,\n",
      "and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,\n",
      "she had determined to make her own absence from home begin\n",
      "when she must give up Anne.  Accordingly their removal was made together,\n",
      "and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage\n",
      "of Lady Russell's journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back\n",
      "had been completely in the old English style, containing only\n",
      "two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;\n",
      "the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,\n",
      "substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,\n",
      "enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree\n",
      "trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire,\n",
      "it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,\n",
      "for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,\n",
      "French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch\n",
      "the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\n",
      "and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Anne had often been staying.  She knew the ways of Uppercross\n",
      "as well as those of Kellynch.  The two families were so continually meeting,\n",
      "so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house\n",
      "at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;\n",
      "but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\n",
      "a matter of course.  Though better endowed than the elder sister,\n",
      "Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper.  While well, and happy,\n",
      "and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;\n",
      "but any indisposition sunk her completely.  She had no resources\n",
      "for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot\n",
      "self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress\n",
      "that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.  In person, she was\n",
      "inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached\n",
      "the dignity of being \"a fine girl.\"  She was now lying on the faded sofa\n",
      "of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which\n",
      "had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers\n",
      "and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.\n",
      "I am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature\n",
      "the whole morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to find you unwell,\" replied Anne.  \"You sent me\n",
      "such a good account of yourself on Thursday!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well\n",
      "at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life\n",
      "as I have been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.\n",
      "Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,\n",
      "and not able to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.\n",
      "I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.\n",
      "\"Oh! Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock.\n",
      "He would go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not\n",
      "stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.\n",
      "I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have had your little boys with you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable\n",
      "that they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind\n",
      "a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully.\n",
      "\"You know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours\n",
      "at the Great House?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them to-day,\n",
      "except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,\n",
      "but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,\n",
      "not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to suit\n",
      "the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves\n",
      "out of their way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.\n",
      "It is early.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal\n",
      "too much for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind\n",
      "of you not to come on Thursday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!\n",
      "You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,\n",
      "and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware\n",
      "that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:\n",
      "and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,\n",
      "have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have\n",
      "left Kellynch sooner.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect\n",
      "in a moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making\n",
      "a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures.\n",
      "I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,\n",
      "trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants\n",
      "are for Lady Russell.  I have had all my own little concerns\n",
      "to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,\n",
      "from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:\n",
      "and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:\n",
      "going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.\n",
      "I was told that they wished it.  But all these things took up\n",
      "a great deal of time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! well!\" and after a moment's pause, \"but you have never asked me\n",
      "one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded\n",
      "you must have been obliged to give up the party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all\n",
      "the matter with me till this morning.  It would have been strange\n",
      "if I had not gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be,\n",
      "and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having\n",
      "a carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were\n",
      "so crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room;\n",
      "and Mr Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into\n",
      "the back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely\n",
      "that my illness to-day may be owing to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\n",
      "on Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon\n",
      "sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able\n",
      "to leave it by dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it,\n",
      "she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;\n",
      "then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough\n",
      "to propose a little walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where shall we go?\" said she, when they were ready.  \"I suppose\n",
      "you will not like to call at the Great House before they have\n",
      "been to see you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne.\n",
      "\"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know\n",
      "so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.\n",
      "They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However,\n",
      "we may as well go and sit with them a little  while, and when we\n",
      "have that over, we can enjoy our walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;\n",
      "but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,\n",
      "though there were on each side continual subjects of offence,\n",
      "neither family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly\n",
      "they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,\n",
      "with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present\n",
      "daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\n",
      "by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables\n",
      "placed in every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits\n",
      "against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\n",
      "the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious\n",
      "of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves\n",
      "seemed to be staring in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,\n",
      "perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old\n",
      "English style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove\n",
      "were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,\n",
      "not much educated, and not at all elegant.  Their children had\n",
      "more modern minds and manners.  There was a numerous family;\n",
      "but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,\n",
      "young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter\n",
      "all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands\n",
      "of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.\n",
      "Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,\n",
      "their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;\n",
      "they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.\n",
      "Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\n",
      "of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some\n",
      "comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\n",
      "of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant\n",
      "and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing\n",
      "but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,\n",
      "that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known\n",
      "so little herself with either of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss\n",
      "on the side of the Great House family, which was generally,\n",
      "as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was\n",
      "chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised\n",
      "at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both\n",
      "the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation.\n",

      "Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal\n",
      "from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles,\n",
      "will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.\n",
      "She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,\n",
      "or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage\n",
      "in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs\n",
      "which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity\n",

      "for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject\n",
      "which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,\n",
      "she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\n",

      "The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,\n",
      "their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females\n",
      "were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,\n",
      "neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be\n",
      "very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate\n",
      "its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become\n",
      "a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.\n",
      "With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,\n",
      "it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,\n",
      "and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive\n",
      "and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;\n",
      "neither was there anything among the other component parts\n",
      "of the cottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms\n",
      "with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well,\n",
      "and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had\n",
      "an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\n",

      "Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was\n",
      "undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,\n",
      "or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,\n",
      "at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,\n",
      "Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match\n",
      "might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding\n",
      "might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,\n",
      "rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was,\n",
      "he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise\n",
      "trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.\n",
      "He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by\n",
      "his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness\n",
      "sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was\n",
      "very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share\n",
      "than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass\n",
      "for a happy couple.  They were always perfectly agreed in the want\n",
      "of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present\n",
      "from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,\n",
      "for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made,\n",
      "he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money,\n",
      "and a right to spend it as he liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the management of their children, his theory was much better\n",
      "than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.  \"I could manage them\n",
      "very well, if it were not for Mary's interference,\" was what\n",
      "Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;\n",
      "but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of \"Charles spoils\n",
      "the children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had\n",
      "the smallest temptation to say, \"Very true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\n",
      "was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,\n",
      "and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.\n",
      "Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,\n",
      "or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.\n",
      "\"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,\"\n",
      "was Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:\n",
      "\"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think\n",
      "there was anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would,\n",
      "you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse\n",
      "than I ever own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary's declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House,\n",
      "though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours\n",
      "and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash\n",
      "and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross\n",
      "for the rest of the day.\"  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity\n",
      "of being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing\n",
      "Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.\n",
      "They are quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure,\n",
      "in general they are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister\n",
      "in the way of managing them.  They are as fine healthy children\n",
      "as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;\n",
      "but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!\n",
      "Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne,\n",
      "it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\n",
      "I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased\n",
      "with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad\n",
      "to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\n",
      "every moment; \"don't do this,\" and \"don't do that;\"  or that one can\n",
      "only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  \"Mrs Musgrove thinks\n",
      "all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason\n",
      "to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,\n",
      "that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being\n",
      "in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.\n",
      "I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery\n",
      "without seeing something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest,\n",
      "steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;\n",
      "for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\"\n",
      "And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, \"I make a rule of never interfering\n",
      "in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do;\n",
      "but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things\n",
      "to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid:\n",
      "I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from\n",
      "my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,\n",
      "that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.\n",
      "Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,\n",
      "that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,\n",
      "you need not be afraid of mentioning it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt\n",
      "not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined\n",
      "at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason\n",
      "why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.\n",
      "And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them\n",
      "after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,\n",
      "\"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are\n",
      "about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\n",
      "you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that\n",
      "it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,\n",
      "especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\n",
      "place of mamma.  Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma,\n",
      "but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.\n",
      "It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,\n",
      "but I know it is taken notice of by many persons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do little more\n",
      "than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each\n",
      "to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\n",
      "between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest\n",
      "which were meant for her sister's benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.\n",
      "Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject,\n",
      "by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened\n",
      "by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse\n",
      "with the other family, since there was neither superior affection,\n",
      "confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,\n",
      "was rather an advantage.  It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible,\n",
      "for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;\n",
      "but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\n",
      "of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places,\n",
      "or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,\n",
      "but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,\n",
      "to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was\n",
      "little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,\n",
      "as she was well aware.  She knew that when she played she was\n",
      "giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.\n",
      "Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age\n",
      "of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness\n",
      "of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.\n",
      "In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;\n",
      "and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters'\n",
      "performance, and total indifference to any other person's,\n",
      "gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification\n",
      "for her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.\n",
      "The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited\n",
      "by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,\n",
      "more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.\n",
      "There were more completely popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,\n",
      "in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins\n",
      "within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,\n",
      "who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come\n",
      "at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,\n",
      "very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,\n",
      "played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which\n",
      "always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove\n",
      "more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--\n",
      "\"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!\n",
      "how those little fingers of yours fly about!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart\n",
      "must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others;\n",
      "all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,\n",
      "beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  She could not\n",
      "think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this\n",
      "sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion\n",
      "to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, \"Dear me, is not this\n",
      "the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?  I am glad I did not\n",
      "think of it before.  How low it makes me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were\n",
      "to be visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.\n",
      "\"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.  She should put it off\n",
      "as long as she could;\" but was not easy till she had talked Charles\n",
      "into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,\n",
      "comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.\n",
      "Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.\n",
      "She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within\n",
      "when the visit was returned.  They came:  the master of the house\n",
      "was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced\n",
      "that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,\n",
      "and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice\n",
      "of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,\n",
      "and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,\n",
      "or in the turn of sentiment and expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,\n",
      "uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.\n",
      "She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;\n",
      "though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence\n",
      "of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to\n",
      "have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.\n",
      "Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had\n",
      "no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any\n",
      "approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.\n",
      "Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration\n",
      "towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:\n",
      "especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,\n",
      "in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest\n",
      "symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias\n",
      "of any sort.  She was quite easy on that head, and consequently\n",
      "full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by\n",
      "Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had\n",
      "the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion\n",
      "she certainly had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?\" added Mrs Croft.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,\n",
      "when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth\n",
      "of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do\n",
      "for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,\n",
      "that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,\n",
      "and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness\n",
      "applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's\n",
      "present state with proper interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,\n",
      "she heard the Admiral say to Mary--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say\n",
      "you know him by name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,\n",
      "clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;\n",
      "and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\n",
      "in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing\n",
      "or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,\n",
      "as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.\n",
      "She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,\n",
      "as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\n",
      "at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day\n",
      "at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits\n",
      "to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,\n",
      "when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming\n",
      "to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,\n",
      "was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,\n",
      "when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,\n",
      "to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it.\n",
      "I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are\n",
      "out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much\n",
      "of poor Richard!  And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,\n",
      "for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you\n",
      "why she is out of spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning,\n",
      "(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,\n",
      "that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,\n",
      "or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;\n",
      "and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone,\n",
      "that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of\n",
      "poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where,\n",
      "but a great while before he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over\n",
      "his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure\n",
      "that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,\n",
      "and of poor Richard!  So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not\n",
      "be dwelling upon such gloomy things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,\n",
      "that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,\n",
      "hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\n",

      "\n",
      "He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him,\n",
      "by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed,\n",

      "He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals\n",

      "should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection\n",
      "of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those\n",
      "extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\n",

      "greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.\n",
      "Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when\n",
      "they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,\n",

      "from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether\n",
      "it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.\n",
      "She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.\n",
      "Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself\n",
      "to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it appear that\n",
      "he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude\n",
      "for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect\n",
      "for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been\n",
      "six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,\n",
      "though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as \"a fine dashing felow,\n",

      "A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,\n",
      "and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,\n",
      "and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,\n",
      "by the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment\n",
      "to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,\n",
      "so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth\n",
      "under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest\n",
      "and best in his cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week,\n",
      "in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;\n",
      "and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,\n",
      "and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.\n",
      "She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,\n",
      "where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,\n",
      "when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment\n",
      "brought home in consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation\n",
      "put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape\n",
      "with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety\n",
      "which they afterwards felt on his account.\n",
      "\n",
      "His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury\n",
      "received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.\n",
      "It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;\n",
      "the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,\n",
      "the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,\n",
      "the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend\n",
      "and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,\n",
      "proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession\n",
      "rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care\n",
      "of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.\n",
      "Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were\n",
      "the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;\n",
      "but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson\n",
      "felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words\n",
      "both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,\n",
      "and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;\n",

      "the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind\n",
      "their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\n",
      "they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable\n",
      "they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,\n",
      "who had been at all a favourite before.  How glad they had been\n",
      "to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said\n",
      "it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised\n",
      "in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come\n",
      "and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;\n",
      "and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt\n",
      "all the motive of their attention just as he ought.  And in short,\n",
      "he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,\n",
      "that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;\n",
      "and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently\n",
      "more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came\n",
      "with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;\n",
      "and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,\n",
      "could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now\n",
      "no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think\n",
      "that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy,\n",
      "to give him the meeting.  \"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,\"\n",
      "both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\n",
      "to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,\n",
      "could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;\n",
      "\"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced\n",
      "to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;\n",
      "he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.\"\n",
      "But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh! no, indeed,\n",

      "should happen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.\n",
      "It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\n",
      "done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,\n",
      "and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity\n",
      "for longer confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused\n",
      "as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?\n",
      "This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,\n",
      "who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.  His father\n",
      "very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being\n",
      "no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his\n",
      "making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,\n",
      "of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he;\n",
      "\"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me\n",
      "quite right.  Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.\n",
      "You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.\n",

      "\n",
      "Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.\n",
      "Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was\n",
      "quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.\n",
      "She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,\n",
      "but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this\n",
      "poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!\n",
      "I knew how it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is\n",
      "anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,\n",
      "and Charles is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say\n",
      "it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.\n",
      "Talks of his being going on so well!  How does he know that he is\n",
      "going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?\n",
      "I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to\n",
      "go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,\n",
      "I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit\n",
      "than anybody else to be about the child.  My being the mother\n",
      "is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all\n",
      "equal to it.  You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--\n",
      "of the shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have\n",
      "nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions,\n",
      "and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.\n",
      "Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.\n",
      "A sick child is always the mother's property:  her own feelings\n",
      "generally make it so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know\n",
      "that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,\n",
      "for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill;\n",
      "and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,\n",
      "he was sure to begin kicking about.  I have not nerves\n",
      "for the sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending\n",
      "the whole evening away from the poor boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so careful;\n",
      "and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I really think\n",
      "Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.\n",
      "I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.\n",
      "I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,\n",
      "suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles\n",
      "to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain\n",
      "with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you serious?\" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  \"Dear me!\n",
      "that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure,\n",
      "I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?\n",
      "and it only harasses me.  You, who have not a mother's feelings,\n",
      "are a great deal the properest person.  You can make little Charles\n",
      "do anything; he always minds you at a word.  It will be a great deal better\n",
      "than leaving him only with Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go;\n",
      "I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me\n",
      "excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know\n",
      "you do not mind being left alone.  An excellent thought of yours,\n",
      "indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.\n",
      "You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything\n",
      "is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.\n",
      "I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease\n",
      "about my dear child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,\n",
      "and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for\n",
      "the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying,\n",
      "in a tone of great exultation--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home\n",
      "than you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,\n",
      "I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.\n",
      "Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.\n",
      "It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be\n",
      "a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is very kind of Anne,\" was her husband's answer, \"and I should be\n",
      "very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be\n",
      "left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity\n",
      "of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction\n",
      "was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being\n",
      "left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,\n",
      "when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her\n",
      "to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;\n",
      "and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\n",
      "set off together in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped,\n",
      "to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;\n",
      "as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,\n",
      "as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.  She knew herself to be\n",
      "of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her\n",
      "if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself\n",
      "agreeable to others?\n",
      "\n",
      "She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.\n",
      "Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.\n",
      "He must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished\n",
      "ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;\n",
      "he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\n",
      "she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him\n",
      "the independence which alone had been wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,\n",
      "and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing,\n",
      "talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners\n",
      "in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all\n",
      "to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning\n",
      "to shoot with Charles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage,\n",
      "though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed\n",
      "to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being\n",
      "in Mrs Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,\n",
      "somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him\n",
      "to breakfast at his father's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquired\n",
      "after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,\n",
      "seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,\n",
      "by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those\n",
      "of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great\n",
      "that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\n",
      "Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was\n",
      "come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;\n",
      "his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth\n",
      "proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;\n",
      "and though Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state\n",
      "as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied\n",
      "without his running on to give notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him,\n",
      "while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was\n",
      "the most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.\n",
      "In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared;\n",
      "they were in the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's,\n",
      "a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,\n",
      "said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,\n",
      "enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons\n",
      "and voices, but a few minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself\n",
      "at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,\n",
      "the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk\n",
      "to the end of the village with the sportsmen:  the room was cleared,\n",
      "and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again,\n",
      "in nervous gratitude.  \"The worst is over!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.\n",
      "They had met.  They had been once more in the same room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.\n",
      "Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.\n",
      "How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\n",
      "had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not\n",
      "eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,\n",
      "removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--\n",
      "how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part\n",
      "of her own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings\n",
      "eight years may be little more than nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like\n",
      "wishing to avoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself\n",
      "for the folly which asked the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\n",
      "might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;\n",
      "for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit\n",
      "at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was\n",
      "so attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,\n",
      "when they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not\n",
      "have known you again.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,\n",
      "but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Altered beyond his knowledge.\"  Anne fully submitted, in silent,\n",
      "deep mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge,\n",
      "for he was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already\n",
      "acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,\n",
      "let him think of her as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed\n",
      "her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,\n",
      "open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.\n",
      "She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So altered that he should not have known her again!\"  These were words\n",
      "which could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice\n",
      "that she had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency;\n",
      "they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must\n",
      "make her happier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,\n",
      "but without an idea that they would be carried round to her.\n",
      "He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,\n",
      "had spoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.\n",
      "She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,\n",
      "she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,\n",
      "confident temper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.\n",
      "It had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been\n",
      "weakness and timidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since\n",
      "whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation\n",
      "of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Her power with him\n",
      "was gone for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned on shore,\n",
      "fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;\n",
      "actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed\n",
      "which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heart\n",
      "for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,\n",
      "in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,\n",
      "excepting Anne Elliot.  This was his only secret exception,\n",
      "when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.\n",
      "Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.\n",
      "A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,\n",
      "and I am a lost man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor,\n",
      "who has had no society among women to make him nice?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye\n",
      "spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was\n",
      "not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described\n",
      "the woman he should wish to meet with.  \"A strong mind,\n",
      "with sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the woman I want,\" said he.  \"Something a little inferior\n",
      "I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,\n",
      "I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject\n",
      "more than most men.\"\n",

      "From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly\n",
      "in the same circle.  They were soon dining in company together\n",
      "at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer\n",
      "supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was\n",
      "but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\n",

      "Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;\n",
      "former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;\n",
      "they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement\n",
      "could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions\n",
      "which conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him,\n",

      "\"That happened before I went to sea in the year six,\" occurred\n",
      "in the course of the first evening they spent together:\n",
      "and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason\n",
      "to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,\n",
      "Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,\n",
      "that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.\n",
      "There must be the same immediate association of thought,\n",
      "though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what\n",
      "the commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!\n",
      "Now nothing!  There had been a time, when of all the large party\n",
      "now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it\n",
      "most difficult to cease to speak to one another.  With the exception,\n",
      "perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached\n",
      "and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among\n",
      "the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,\n",
      "no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.\n",
      "Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could\n",
      "never become acquainted.  It was a perpetual estrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.\n",
      "There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party;\n",
      "and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,\n",
      "who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner\n",
      "of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise\n",
      "at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\n",
      "which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,\n",
      "which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,\n",
      "and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\n",
      "without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,\n",
      "or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper\n",
      "of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,\n",
      "I dare say he would have been just such another by this time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove\n",
      "relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,\n",
      "could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she could let her attention take its natural course again,\n",
      "she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List\n",
      "(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),\n",
      "and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view\n",
      "of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.\n",
      "I was the last man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.\n",
      "Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off\n",
      "to the West Indies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls looked all amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Admiralty,\" he continued, \"entertain themselves now and then,\n",
      "with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.\n",
      "But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands\n",
      "that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible\n",
      "for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phoo! phoo!\" cried the Admiral, \"what stuff these young fellows talk!\n",
      "Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old built sloop,\n",
      "you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knows there\n",
      "must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\n",
      "at the same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,\n",
      "with no more interest than his.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;\" replied Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "seriously.  \"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.\n",
      "It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;\n",
      "a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore\n",
      "for half a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants\n",
      "to be afloat again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been\n",
      "when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling.\n",
      "\"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\n",
      "the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen\n",
      "lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,\n",
      "and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.\n",
      "Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.\n",
      "I knew she would.  I knew that we should either go to the bottom together,\n",
      "or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days\n",
      "of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after\n",
      "taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck\n",
      "in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate\n",
      "I wanted.  I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.\n",
      "We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,\n",
      "which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for\n",
      "poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation\n",
      "not having much improved our condition.  Four-and-twenty hours later,\n",
      "and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost\n",
      "in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\" Anne's shudderings\n",
      "were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open\n",
      "as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,\n",
      "as if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there\n",
      "he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear,\" (beckoning him to her),\n",
      "\"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.\n",
      "I always forgot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar,\n",
      "with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid\n",
      "of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure\n",
      "to hear him talked of by such a good friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,\n",
      "only nodded in reply, and walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth\n",
      "could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\n",
      "into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud\n",
      "the little statement of her name and rate, and present\n",
      "non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been\n",
      "one of the best friends man ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I\n",
      "made money in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise\n",
      "together off the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!\n",
      "You know how much he wanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.\n",
      "Excellent fellow.  I shall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all,\n",
      "so much for her sake.  I wished for him again the next summer,\n",
      "when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am sure, Sir.\" said Mrs Musgrove, \"it was a lucky day for us,\n",
      "when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget\n",
      "what you did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all\n",
      "near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking\n",
      "of poor Richard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor dear fellow!\" continued Mrs Musgrove; \"he was grown so steady,\n",
      "and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!\n",
      "Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.\n",
      "I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this speech,\n",
      "a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,\n",
      "which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind wishes,\n",
      "as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;\n",
      "but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected\n",
      "by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment\n",
      "he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards\n",
      "coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,\n",
      "took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,\n",
      "in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy\n",
      "and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all\n",
      "that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had\n",
      "most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.\n",
      "It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of\n",
      "a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature\n",
      "to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;\n",
      "and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,\n",
      "may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth\n",
      "should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which\n",
      "he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,\n",
      "whom alive nobody had cared for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.\n",
      "A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,\n",
      "as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair or not fair,\n",
      "there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--\n",
      "which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\n",
      "with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,\n",
      "now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation\n",
      "of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,\n",
      "began with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,\n",
      "you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson\n",
      "and her daughters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;\n",
      "though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\n",
      "on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,\n",
      "which a few hours might comprehend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry\n",
      "towards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,\n",
      "with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make\n",
      "the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.\n",
      "There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women\n",
      "to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.  I hate to hear\n",
      "of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command\n",
      "shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This brought his sister upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you. --All idle refinement!\n",
      "--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.\n",
      "I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know\n",
      "nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I declare\n",
      "I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\"\n",
      "(with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of\n",
      "the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing to the purpose,\" replied her brother.  \"You were living\n",
      "with your husband, and were the only woman on board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,\n",
      "and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this\n",
      "superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any\n",
      "brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything\n",
      "of Harville's from the world's end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine\n",
      "that I did not feel it an evil in itself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number\n",
      "of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would\n",
      "become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to\n",
      "one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville\n",
      "and all her family to Plymouth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,\n",
      "and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.\n",
      "We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! my dear,\" said the Admiral, \"when he had got a wife,\n",
      "he will sing a different tune.  When he is married, if we have\n",
      "the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I,\n",
      "and a great many others, have done.  We shall have him very thankful\n",
      "to anybody that will bring him his wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, that we shall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I have done,\" cried Captain Wentworth.  \"When once married\n",
      "people begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,\n",
      "when you are married.'  I can only say, `No, I shall not;' and then\n",
      "they say again, `Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and moved away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove\n",
      "to Mrs Croft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;\n",
      "though many women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic\n",
      "four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,\n",
      "and only once; besides being in different places about home:\n",
      "Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.  But I never went beyond the Streights,\n",
      "and never was in the West Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,\n",
      "you know, the West Indies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself\n",
      "of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I do assure you, ma'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed\n",
      "the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.\n",
      "When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;\n",
      "though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;\n",
      "and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent\n",
      "on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was nothing\n",
      "to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with\n",
      "excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little disordered\n",
      "always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew\n",
      "what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really suffered\n",
      "in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,\n",
      "or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal,\n",
      "when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.\n",
      "I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of\n",
      "imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,\n",
      "or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,\n",
      "nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,\n",
      "Mrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  \"There is nothing so bad\n",
      "as a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is,\n",
      "for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when\n",
      "they are over, and he is safe back again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed,\n",
      "Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes\n",
      "fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad\n",
      "to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits\n",
      "than Captain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate\n",
      "him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention\n",
      "of all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females\n",
      "of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted\n",
      "to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,\n",
      "they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but\n",

      "on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,\n",
      "and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions\n",
      "of Uppercross induced him to put this off.  There was so much\n",
      "of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching\n",

      "introduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,\n",
      "where residence was not required, lived at his father's house,\n",
      "only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home\n",
      "had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,\n",

      "with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen\n",

      "four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter\n",
      "had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions\n",
      "of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.\n",

      "of your new creations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred\n",
      "on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished\n",
      "to see put an end to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters,\n",
      "and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\n",
      "between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;\n",
      "and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,\n",
      "she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman\n",
      "has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\n",
      "to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections\n",
      "to those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?\n",

      "a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,\n",
      "and he saw things as an eldest son himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer.\n",
      "\"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has\n",
      "a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from\n",
      "the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,\n",
      "that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very\n",
      "pretty property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than\n",
      "two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,\n",
      "which is some of the best land in the country.  I grant you,\n",
      "that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,\n",
      "and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;\n",
      "but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop\n",
      "comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,\n",
      "and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,\n",
      "he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.  No, no;\n",
      "Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,\n",
      "and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as\n",
      "he was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta\n",
      "marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse\n",
      "for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth\n",
      "may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt\n",
      "that he has.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.\n",
      "I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to\n",
      "Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense\n",
      "to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.\n",
      "But Charles is so positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday,\n",
      "for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you\n",
      "would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined\n",
      "to give it against me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things\n",
      "should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,\n",
      "under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return\n",
      "of indisposition in little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding\n",
      "Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\n",
      "was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence\n",
      "that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\n",
      "the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,\n",
      "than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.\n",
      "Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,\n",
      "good-humoured wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy\n",
      "which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning\n",
      "young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\n",
      "it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\n",
      "of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\n",
      "in his cousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him\n",
      "to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\n",
      "every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\n",
      "from Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming,\n",
      "when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as\n",
      "the probable cause.  He had been absent only two Sundays,\n",
      "and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height\n",
      "of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,\n",
      "and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then seemed the object\n",
      "nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than\n",
      "forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,\n",
      "but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed\n",
      "on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good\n",
      "as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.\n",
      "The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going\n",
      "six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;\n",
      "of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's\n",
      "being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\n",
      "without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,\n",
      "but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he came back, alas!\n",
      "the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not listen at all\n",
      "to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:\n",
      "she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta\n",
      "had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten\n",
      "all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;\n",
      "I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short,\n",
      "you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.\n",
      "Is he coming, Louisa?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,\n",
      "at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into\n",
      "the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little\n",
      "invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,\n",
      "deprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started,\n",
      "and could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked\n",
      "to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments,\n",
      "I dare say,\" had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural;\n",
      "and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,\n",
      "she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released\n",
      "Captain Wentworth as well as herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,\n",
      "\"I hope the little boy is better,\" was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there\n",
      "to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,\n",
      "when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person\n",
      "crossing the little vestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head,\n",
      "to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one\n",
      "much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,\n",
      "probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth\n",
      "than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "She only attempted to say, \"How do you do?  Will you not sit down?\n",
      "The others will be here presently.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently\n",
      "not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end\n",
      "to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up\n",
      "the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy,\n",
      "a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door\n",
      "opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance\n",
      "among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,\n",
      "and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.\n",
      "\n",
      "There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;\n",
      "and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,\n",
      "he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,\n",
      "busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.\n",
      "She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.\n",
      "Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had\n",
      "the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Walter,\" said she, \"get down this moment.  You are extremely troublesome.\n",
      "I am very angry with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?\n",
      "Do not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to\n",
      "cousin Charles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit did Walter stir.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of\n",
      "being released from him; some one was taking him from her,\n",
      "though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands\n",
      "were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,\n",
      "before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.\n",
      "She could not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,\n",
      "with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward\n",
      "to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,\n",
      "the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon\n",
      "forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,\n",
      "that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought\n",
      "to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,\n",
      "produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,\n",
      "as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary\n",
      "and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,\n",
      "and leave the room.  She could not stay.  It might have been\n",
      "an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--\n",
      "they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.\n",
      "It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards\n",
      "Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of his having said,\n",
      "in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's interference,\n",
      "\"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;\"\n",
      "and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do\n",
      "what he ought to have done himself.  But neither Charles Hayter's feelings,\n",
      "nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better\n",
      "arranged her own.  She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed\n",
      "of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,\n",
      "and it required a long application of solitude and reflection\n",
      "to recover her.\n",

      "before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,\n",

      "Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely\n",
      "what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity\n",
      "which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being\n",
      "to be communicated, and everything being to be done together,\n",
      "however undesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going,\n",
      "but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept\n",
      "the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,\n",
      "as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening\n",
      "the interference in any plan of their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\"\n",
      "said Mary, as she went up stairs.  \"Everybody is always supposing\n",
      "that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,\n",
      "if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this manner\n",
      "on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken out\n",
      "a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.\n",
      "Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready\n",
      "for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne\n",
      "have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,\n",
      "from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was\n",
      "too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together\n",
      "in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently\n",
      "considered the walk as under their guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where\n",
      "the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,\n",
      "to keep with her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk\n",
      "must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of\n",
      "the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,\n",
      "and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\n",
      "descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and\n",
      "inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,\n",
      "that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,\n",
      "some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.\n",
      "She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\n",
      "and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach\n",
      "of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,\n",
      "she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.\n",
      "It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,\n",
      "might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.\n",
      "Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.\n",
      "This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech\n",
      "of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises of the day,\n",
      "which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to take\n",
      "a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from\n",
      "some of these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.\n",
      "I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen\n",
      "very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;\n",
      "she would as lieve be tossed out as not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,\" cried Louisa, \"but if it were\n",
      "really so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,\n",
      "as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever\n",
      "separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely\n",
      "by anybody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was spoken with enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\"\n",
      "And there was silence between them for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet scenes\n",
      "of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,\n",
      "fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining\n",
      "happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,\n",
      "blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as they struck by order\n",
      "into another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\"\n",
      "But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes\n",
      "to be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;\n",
      "and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,\n",
      "where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\n",
      "counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning\n",
      "to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill,\n",
      "which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view\n",
      "of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them\n",
      "an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and\n",
      "buildings of a farm-yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary exclaimed, \"Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!\n",
      "Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles\n",
      "walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready\n",
      "to do as Mary wished; but \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and \"No, no!\"\n",
      "cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be\n",
      "arguing the matter warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution\n",
      "of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,\n",
      "though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.\n",
      "But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;\n",
      "and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\n",
      "of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,\n",
      "\"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm\n",
      "than any sitting down could do her good;\" and, in short,\n",
      "her look and manner declared, that go she would not.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,\n",
      "it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he\n",
      "and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt\n",
      "and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\n",
      "of the hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;\n",
      "and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking\n",
      "to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her,\n",
      "and saying to Captain Wentworth--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you,\n",
      "I have never been in the house above twice in my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,\n",
      "followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne\n",
      "perfectly knew the meaning of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:\n",
      "Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself\n",
      "on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others\n",
      "all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,\n",
      "to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,\n",
      "and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,\n",
      "Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,\n",
      "was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could\n",
      "prevent her from going to look for a better also.  She turned through\n",
      "the same gate, but could not see them.  Anne found a nice seat\n",
      "for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which\n",
      "she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.\n",
      "Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa\n",
      "had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on\n",
      "till she overtook her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard\n",
      "Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if\n",
      "making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the\n",
      "centre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was\n",
      "the first distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some\n",
      "eager speech.  What Anne first heard was--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightened\n",
      "from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from\n",
      "doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,\n",
      "by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?\n",
      "No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have\n",
      "made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely\n",
      "to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near\n",
      "giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She would have turned back then, but for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints\n",
      "you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,\n",
      "the last time I was in company with him,  I need not affect\n",
      "to have no comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than\n",
      "a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;\n",
      "and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,\n",
      "when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\n",
      "strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist\n",
      "idle interference in such a trifle as this.  Your sister is\n",
      "an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,\n",
      "I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much\n",
      "of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, no doubt,\n",
      "you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too yielding\n",
      "and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\n",
      "You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody\n",
      "may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is a nut,\"\n",
      "said he, catching one down from an upper bough.  \"to exemplify:\n",
      "a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,\n",
      "has outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not\n",
      "a weak spot anywhere.  This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity,\n",
      "\"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,\n",
      "is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\n",
      "supposed capable of.\"  Then returning to his former earnest tone--\n",
      "\"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.\n",
      "If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,\n",
      "she will cherish all her present powers of mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if Louisa\n",
      "could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such interest,\n",
      "spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.\n",
      "For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.\n",
      "While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,\n",
      "and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,\n",
      "however, Louisa spoke again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she;\n",
      "\"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense\n",
      "and pride--the Elliot pride.  She has a great deal too much\n",
      "of the Elliot pride.  We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.\n",
      "I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean that she refused him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes; certainly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When did that happen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;\n",
      "but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had\n",
      "accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better;\n",
      "and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\n",
      "Lady Russell's doing, that she did not.  They think Charles\n",
      "might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,\n",
      "and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\n",
      "Her own emotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from,\n",
      "before she could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was\n",
      "not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard\n",
      "a great deal of very painful import.  She saw how her own character\n",
      "was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree\n",
      "of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\n",
      "extreme agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,\n",
      "and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,\n",
      "felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\n",
      "collected, and once more in motion together.  Her spirits wanted\n",
      "the solitude and silence which only numbers could give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,\n",
      "Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne\n",
      "could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem\n",
      "admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing\n",
      "on the gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they\n",
      "were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.\n",
      "Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--\n",
      "Charles Hayter exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other\n",
      "almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;\n",
      "nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,\n",
      "or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much\n",
      "as the other two.  In a long strip of meadow land, where there was\n",
      "ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties;\n",
      "and to that party of the three which boasted least animation,\n",
      "and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.  She joined Charles\n",
      "and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm;\n",
      "but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper\n",
      "with his wife.  Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,\n",
      "and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was\n",
      "his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\n",
      "of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began\n",
      "to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,\n",
      "in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,\n",
      "he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\n",
      "a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it\n",
      "was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,\n",
      "the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been\n",
      "some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.\n",
      "He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.\n",
      "Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,\n",
      "they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;\n",
      "it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.\n",
      "The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves\n",
      "were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked\n",
      "before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride\n",
      "could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an\n",
      "opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,\n",
      "when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\n",
      "to his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft.\n",
      "\"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room\n",
      "for three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might\n",
      "sit four.  You must, indeed, you must.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,\n",
      "she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency\n",
      "came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused;\n",
      "they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\n",
      "to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,\n",
      "turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he had\n",
      "placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it,\n",
      "that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution\n",
      "to give her rest.  She was very much affected by the view of\n",
      "his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.\n",
      "This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.\n",
      "She understood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not\n",
      "be unfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it\n",
      "with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,\n",
      "and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,\n",
      "without the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder\n",
      "of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged\n",
      "friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,\n",
      "which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\n",
      "of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\n",
      "were at first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way\n",
      "along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.\n",
      "She then found them talking of \"Frederick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,\"\n",
      "said the Admiral; \"but there is no saying which.  He has been\n",
      "running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.\n",
      "Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have\n",
      "settled it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make\n",
      "long courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear,\n",
      "between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\n",
      "in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had better not talk about it, my dear,\" replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;\n",
      "\"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,\n",
      "she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.\n",
      "I had known you by character, however, long before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we\n",
      "to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.\n",
      "I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home\n",
      "one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always\n",
      "be company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are;\n",
      "I hardly know one from the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft,\n",
      "in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that\n",
      "her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\n",
      "of her brother; \"and a very respectable family.  One could not be\n",
      "connected with better people.  My dear Admiral, that post!\n",
      "we shall certainly take that post.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\n",
      "passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\n",
      "her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;\n",
      "and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,\n",
      "which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\n",
      "of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.\n",

      "quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville\n",
      "had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\n",

      "had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there\n",
      "for four-and-twenty hours.  His acquittal was complete,\n",
      "his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,\n",
      "and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to\n",

      "Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed\n",
      "the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,\n",
      "being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,\n",

      "The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night;\n",
      "but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;\n",
      "and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in\n",
      "the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,\n",
      "after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,\n",
      "for going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,\n",
      "and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was felt\n",
      "to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House\n",
      "at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,\n",
      "it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach\n",
      "containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which\n",
      "he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,\n",
      "and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,\n",

      "or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms\n",
      "were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family\n",

      "skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,\n",
      "is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,\n",
      "its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful\n",

      "the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,\n",

      "to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,\n",
      "Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,\n",
      "and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,\n",
      "where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot\n",
      "for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;\n",

      "the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,\n",
      "declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first\n",
      "partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,\n",

      "on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,\n",
      "proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself\n",

      "and he was to join them on the Cobb.\n",

      "They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa\n",

      "when they saw him coming after them, with three companions,\n",
      "all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,\n",
      "and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.\n",
      "\n",

      "on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as\n",
      "an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,\n",
      "which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,\n",
      "had been followed by a little history of his private life,\n",
      "which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.\n",
      "He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now\n",
      "mourning her loss.  They had been a year or two waiting for fortune\n",
      "and promotion.  Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great;\n",
      "promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.\n",
      "She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth\n",
      "believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\n",
      "than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply\n",
      "afflicted under the dreadful change.  He considered his disposition\n",
      "as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings\n",
      "with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,\n",
      "and sedentary pursuits.  To finish the interest of the story,\n",
      "the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,\n",
      "augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,\n",
      "and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.  Captain Harville\n",
      "had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,\n",
      "and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,\n",
      "and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement\n",
      "of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's\n",
      "state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick\n",
      "was very great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward\n",

      "younger as a man.  He will rally again, and be happy with another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall,\n",
      "dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;\n",
      "and from strong features and want of health, looking much older\n",
      "than Captain Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was,\n",
      "the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,\n",
      "a little man.  He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,\n",
      "just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,\n",
      "was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.\n",
      "Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,\n",
      "to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant\n",

      "than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.\n",
      "The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,\n",
      "accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth\n",
      "should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it\n",
      "as a thing of course that they should dine with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,\n",
      "and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,\n",
      "so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners\n",
      "of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be\n",
      "benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.\n",
      "\"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought;\n",
      "and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.\n",
      "\n",
      "On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,\n",
      "and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\n",
      "could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had\n",
      "a moment's astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost\n",
      "in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\n",
      "the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,\n",
      "to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies\n",
      "of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors\n",
      "against the winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in\n",

      "provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,\n",
      "were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,\n",
      "excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable\n",
      "from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,\n",
      "were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,\n",
      "the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,\n",
      "the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,\n",
      "made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived\n",
      "excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,\n",
      "for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of\n",
      "Captain Benwick.  His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;\n",
      "but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\n",
      "constant employment within.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,\n",
      "he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles\n",
      "and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,\n",
      "sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.\n",

      "burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\n",
      "of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,\n",
      "their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\n",
      "more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;\n",

      "\"so entirely out of season,\" and the \"no thoroughfare of Lyme,\"\n",
      "and the \"no expectation of company,\" had brought many apologies\n",
      "from the heads of the inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\n",
      "to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined\n",
      "could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,\n",
      "and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\n",
      "(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.\n",

      "had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick\n",
      "had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\n",
      "so many strangers.  He ventured among them again, however,\n",

      "While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room,\n",

      "rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse\n",
      "of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.\n",
      "He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of\n",
      "her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;\n",
      "and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.\n",
      "He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,\n",
      "though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having\n",
      "given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects,\n",
      "which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope\n",
      "of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\n",
      "benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out\n",

      "usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of\n",
      "the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\n",
      "as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion\n",
      "or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour\n",
      "and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,\n",
      "he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\n",
      "of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\n",
      "of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines\n",
      "which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,\n",
      "and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,\n",
      "that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,\n",
      "and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\n",
      "seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;\n",

      "She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;\n",

      "having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\n",
      "which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye\n",
      "which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,\n",
      "(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.\n",
      "Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\n",
      "shewed his noticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance,\n",
      "a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you,\n",
      "and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about\n",
      "a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards\n",
      "quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against\n",
      "the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.\n",
      "She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,\n",
      "and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about\n",
      "near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.\n",
      "Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.\n",
      "It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;\n",
      "and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again\n",
      "by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely,\n",
      "and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was\n",
      "a man of exceedingly good manners.  He seemed about thirty,\n",
      "and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.  Anne felt that\n",
      "she should like to know who he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,\n",
      "(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party\n",
      "to the window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle,\n",
      "but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;\n",
      "somebody must be going away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might\n",
      "compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity,\n",
      "and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner\n",
      "of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\n",
      "and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne,\n",
      "\"it is the very man we passed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him\n",
      "as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.\n",
      "The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray,\" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, \"can you tell us the name\n",
      "of the gentleman who is just gone away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night\n",
      "from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were\n",
      "at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath\n",
      "and London.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elliot!\"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name,\n",
      "before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity\n",
      "of a waiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me!\" cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,\n",
      "it must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, you see,\n",
      "just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!\n",
      "In the very same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?\n",
      "my father's next heir?  Pray sir,\" turning to the waiter,\n",
      "\"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged\n",
      "to the Kellynch family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said\n",
      "his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There! you see!\" cried Mary in an ecstasy, \"just as I said!\n",
      "Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out,\n",
      "if it was so.  Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants\n",
      "take care to publish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive\n",
      "how extraordinary!  I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had\n",
      "been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.\n",
      "What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!\n",
      "Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him,\n",
      "I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something\n",
      "of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!\n",
      "Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,\n",
      "so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,\n",
      "and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,\n",
      "one should have known him by the livery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,\"\n",
      "said Captain Wentworth, \"we must consider it to be the arrangement\n",
      "of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried\n",
      "to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,\n",
      "been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\n",
      "at all desirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself\n",
      "to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch\n",
      "was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.\n",
      "She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him\n",
      "the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having\n",
      "passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt\n",
      "quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage,\n",
      "and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been\n",
      "near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain\n",
      "a perfect secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,\n",
      "the next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly\n",
      "ought to hear of it; do mention all about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance\n",
      "which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,\n",
      "but as what ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given\n",
      "her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it\n",
      "she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both\n",
      "was beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil\n",
      "of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth\n",
      "fell on Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain\n",
      "and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed\n",
      "to take their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off\n",
      "for Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,\n",
      "and out of doors as long as they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all\n",
      "fairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening\n",
      "did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together\n",
      "some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,\n",
      "and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,\n",
      "to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something\n",
      "occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of\n",
      "Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Elliot,\" said he, speaking rather low, \"you have done a good deed\n",
      "in making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have\n",
      "such company oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;\n",
      "but what can we do?  We cannot part.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible;\n",
      "but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,\n",
      "and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend\n",
      "may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,\n",
      "just made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him;\n",
      "he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.\n",
      "There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.\n",
      "I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could do it,\n",
      "but that good fellow\" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  \"The Laconia\n",
      "had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her\n",
      "being sent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest;\n",
      "wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,\n",
      "travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off\n",
      "to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.\n",
      "That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\n",
      "You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much\n",
      "in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed\n",
      "able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,\n",
      "and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\n",
      "quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction\n",
      "of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would\n",
      "accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.\n",
      "By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew\n",
      "near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,\n",
      "all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,\n",
      "that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,\n",
      "would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,\n",
      "and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\n",
      "may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville\n",
      "at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,\n",
      "who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make\n",
      "the proper adieus to the Cobb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron's\n",
      "\"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by\n",
      "their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\n",
      "attention was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant\n",
      "for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,\n",
      "and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,\n",
      "excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.\n",
      "In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;\n",
      "the sensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement\n",
      "for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;\n",
      "he did it, however.  She was safely down, and instantly,\n",
      "to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.\n",
      "He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,\n",
      "he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, \"I am determined\n",
      "I will:\" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,\n",
      "she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!\n",
      "There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,\n",
      "she breathed not, her face was like death.  The horror of the moment\n",
      "to all who stood around!\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,\n",
      "looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.\n",
      "\"She is dead! she is dead!\" screamed Mary, catching hold of her\n",
      "husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;\n",
      "and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost\n",
      "her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain\n",
      "Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there no one to help me?\" were the first words which\n",
      "burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if\n",
      "all his own strength were gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven's sake go to him.\n",
      "I can support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands,\n",
      "rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,\n",
      "disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;\n",
      "and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,\n",
      "and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;\n",
      "while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,\n",
      "exclaimed in the bitterest agony--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh God! her father and mother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A surgeon!\" said Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--\n",
      "\"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away,\n",
      "when Anne eagerly suggested--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?\n",
      "He knows where a surgeon is to be found.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,\n",
      "and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had\n",
      "resigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care,\n",
      "and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said\n",
      "which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:\n",
      "Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate\n",
      "brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes\n",
      "from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,\n",
      "or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him\n",
      "for help which he could not give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,\n",
      "which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,\n",
      "to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,\n",
      "to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to her\n",
      "for directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?\n",
      "What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure:\n",
      "carry her gently to the inn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, to the inn,\" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively\n",
      "collected, and eager to be doing something.  \"I will carry her myself.\n",
      "Musgrove, take care of the others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\n",
      "and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,\n",
      "to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of\n",
      "a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine\n",
      "as the first report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people\n",
      "Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,\n",
      "she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,\n",
      "and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back\n",
      "with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,\n",
      "and so light of heart, they had passed along.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.\n",
      "Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance\n",
      "which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,\n",
      "informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.\n",
      "Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves\n",
      "that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife\n",
      "decided what was to be done.  She must be taken to their house;\n",
      "all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.\n",
      "They would not listen to scruples:  he was obeyed; they were all\n",
      "beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction,\n",
      "was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,\n",
      "assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband\n",
      "to all who needed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,\n",
      "without apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life,\n",
      "however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly\n",
      "incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,\n",
      "by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.\n",
      "Mary, too, was growing calmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.\n",
      "They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.\n",
      "The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries\n",
      "recovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say\n",
      "a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;\n",
      "and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,\n",
      "after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,\n",
      "may be conceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered\n",
      "by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;\n",
      "nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it\n",
      "with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by\n",
      "the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection\n",
      "to calm them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done,\n",
      "as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to each other\n",
      "and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing\n",
      "to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,\n",
      "did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  The Harvilles\n",
      "silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.\n",
      "They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\n",
      "began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,\n",
      "and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.\n",
      "They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;\n",
      "and yet perhaps, by \"putting the children away in the maid's room,\n",
      "or swinging a cot somewhere,\" they could hardly bear to think of not\n",
      "finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay;\n",
      "though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be\n",
      "the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.\n",
      "Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,\n",
      "who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,\n",
      "was just such another.  Between these two, she could want\n",
      "no possible attendance by day or night.  And all this was said\n",
      "with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,\n",
      "and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.\n",
      "\"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross;\n",
      "the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;\n",
      "the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they\n",
      "ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.\"\n",
      "At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\n",
      "than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "exerting himself, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.\n",
      "Every minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off\n",
      "for Uppercross instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.\n",
      "He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;\n",
      "but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.\n",
      "So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.\n",
      "She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The usefulness\n",
      "of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's room,\n",
      "or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!\n",
      "She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,\n",
      "yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought\n",
      "of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,\n",
      "she was anxious to be at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly\n",
      "down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed,\n",
      "for the parlour door was open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "\"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.\n",
      "But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,\n",
      "I think it need be only one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,\n",
      "wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,\n",
      "so capable as Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\n",
      "so spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said,\n",
      "and she then appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;\" cried he,\n",
      "turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,\n",
      "which seemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply,\n",
      "and he recollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself\n",
      "most willing, ready, happy to remain.  \"It was what she had been\n",
      "thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor\n",
      "in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville\n",
      "would but think so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather desirable\n",
      "that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\n",
      "share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses\n",
      "to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;\n",
      "and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,\n",
      "that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,\n",
      "and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home\n",
      "the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage\n",
      "of sending an account of Louisa's night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,\n",
      "and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was\n",
      "made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.\n",
      "She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice\n",
      "in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was\n",
      "nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right\n",
      "to stay in Henrietta's stead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?\n",
      "And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!\n",
      "No, it was too unkind.  And in short, she said more than her husband\n",
      "could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose\n",
      "when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne\n",
      "was inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\n",
      "and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off\n",
      "for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick\n",
      "attending to her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along,\n",
      "to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\n",
      "earlier in the morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes\n",
      "for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had\n",
      "first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given\n",
      "to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,\n",
      "united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt\n",
      "an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even\n",
      "in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing\n",
      "their acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting,\n",
      "stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;\n",
      "but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\n",
      "for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,\n",
      "the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to,\n",
      "made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her\n",
      "that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating\n",
      "the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have\n",
      "attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,\n",
      "for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\n",
      "as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean while she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,\n",
      "and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these\n",
      "circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.\n",
      "How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;\n",
      "what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.\n",
      "It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted to Henrietta;\n",
      "always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view\n",
      "of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  In general,\n",
      "his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrietta\n",
      "from agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only,\n",
      "when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated\n",
      "walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,\n",
      "he burst forth, as if wholly overcome--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,\" he cried.  \"Oh God! that I had\n",
      "not given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!\n",
      "But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness\n",
      "of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\n",
      "of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,\n",
      "like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions\n",
      "and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\n",
      "that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\n",
      "as a very resolute character.\n",
      "\n",
      "They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\n",
      "and the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by\n",
      "some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long\n",
      "as on the day before.  It was growing quite dusk, however,\n",
      "before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been\n",
      "total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back\n",
      "in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her\n",
      "having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill,\n",
      "Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.\n",
      "In a low, cautious voice, he said: --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not\n",
      "appear at first.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether\n",
      "you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in\n",
      "and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance\n",
      "of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,\n",
      "and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became\n",
      "a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,\n",
      "and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped,\n",
      "and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced\n",
      "his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;\n",
      "and when the horses were baited, he was off.\n",

      "The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,\n",
      "was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction\n",
      "of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,\n",
      "and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,\n",
      "in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have\n",
      "been difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was\n",
      "much the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.\n",
      "Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and\n",
      "more particular account.  He was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure\n",
      "must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well\n",
      "as the nature of the case admitted.  In speaking of the Harvilles,\n",
      "he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,\n",
      "especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.  \"She really left\n",
      "nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had been persuaded to go early\n",

      "prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,\n",
      "that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father\n",
      "had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.\n",
      "It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,\n",
      "and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed\n",
      "and was acted upon.  A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,\n",
      "and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid\n",
      "of the family, one who having brought up all the children,\n",
      "and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,\n",
      "sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery\n",
      "to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\n",
      "get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being\n",
      "allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of\n",
      "getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;\n",
      "but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,\n",
      "and found practicable so soon.\n",

      "They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all\n",
      "the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain\n",
      "every twenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme,\n",
      "and his account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense\n",
      "and consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed\n",
      "in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.\n",
      "\"What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters\n",

      "she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\n",
      "to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.\n",
      "She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;\n",
      "go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,\n",
      "as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.\n",
      "They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;\n",
      "they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;\n",
      "and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted\n",
      "with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her\n",
      "last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,\n",
      "and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left\n",

      "to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome;\n",

      "in September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of\n",
      "its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade\n",
      "and escape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modern\n",

      "\n",
      "There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.\n",
      "She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily,\n",
      "either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell\n",
      "fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,\n",
      "had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\n",
      "of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\n",
      "a second spring of youth and beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.\n",
      "The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,\n",
      "and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother\n",
      "among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.\n",
      "She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.\n",
      "Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;\n",

      "and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,\n",

      "be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known\n",
      "how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,\n",
      "and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her\n",
      "was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,\n",
      "than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy\n",
      "with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exert herself\n",

      "on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\n",

      "Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,\n",
      "when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must\n",
      "be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,\n",
      "lament the result, and Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.\n",
      "Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.\n",
      "She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to\n",
      "Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\n",
      "briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.\n",
      "When this was told, his name distressed her no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,\n",
      "but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,\n",
      "that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat\n",
      "of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,\n",
      "be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance\n",
      "to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,\n",
      "which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought\n",
      "a rather improving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period,\n",

      "By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact\n",
      "so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father\n",
      "so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure\n",
      "of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,\n",
      "that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,\n",
      "she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\n",
      "who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed\n",
      "into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must unquestionably\n",
      "have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded\n",

      "to be so driven away!  Strangers filling their place!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,\n",
      "and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared\n",
      "that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;\n",
      "that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time\n",
      "since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had\n",
      "not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours\n",
      "and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention\n",
      "of quitting it any more.  He had enquired after her, she found,\n",
      "particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being\n",
      "the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.\n",
      "This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\n",
      "could have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style\n",
      "by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work\n",
      "on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been\n",
      "the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;\n",
      "that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,\n",
      "how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable\n",
      "she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!\n",

      "\"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this,\n",
      "for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head,\n",
      "is not it, Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,\n",
      "truly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,\n",
      "but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicity\n",
      "of character were irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, this must be very bad for you,\" said he, suddenly rousing from\n",
      "a little reverie, \"to be coming and finding us here.  I had not\n",
      "recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.\n",
      "But now, do not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms\n",

      "\"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery\n",
      "at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\n",
      "by that door.  A good place is not it?  But,\" (checking himself),\n",
      "\"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept\n",
      "in the butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.\n",
      "One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.\n",
      "And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you\n",
      "to go about the house or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.\n",

      "after thinking a moment.  \"Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door,\n",
      "at Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.\n",
      "The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\n",
      "of its opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter\n",
      "what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\n",
      "the house ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say,\n",
      "that the few alterations we have made have been all very much\n",
      "for the better.  My wife should have the credit of them, however.\n",
      "I have done very little besides sending away some of the large\n",
      "looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's.\n",

      "\"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.\n",
      "Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away\n",
      "from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon\n",
      "shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my\n",
      "little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing\n",
      "that I never go near.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,\n",
      "pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are\n",

      "with the place.  The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,\n",
      "I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,\n",
      "which may not happen three times a winter.  And take it altogether,\n",
      "now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,\n",
      "there is not one that we like better than this.  Pray say so,\n",

      "far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced\n",
      "themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions\n",
      "in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again\n",
      "before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.\n",

      "they drove over to the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up;\n",

      "Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when\n",
      "they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait,\n",

      "on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much\n",
      "going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings\n",
      "and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,\n",
      "and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been\n",
      "much in favour of Lyme.  She had been taken to Charmouth too,\n",
      "and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many\n",
      "more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;\n",

      "I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,\n",
      "he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot' and he had\n",
      "`been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had\n",

      "\"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:\n",
      "he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered\n",

      "His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,\n",
      "and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other\n",
      "in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,\n",

      "of Miss Elliot's charms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit,\n",

      "you will agree with me.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,\"\n",
      "said Charles.  \"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,\n",
      "and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,\n",
      "he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,\n",
      "you may depend on it.  I told him the distance and the road,\n",
      "and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing;\n",
      "for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would\n",
      "be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;\n",
      "and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.\n",
      "So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.\n",
      "He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked with me,\n",
      "sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.\n",
      "He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not like him.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So do I, Anne,\" said Charles.  \"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.\n",

      "read all day long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that he will!\" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  \"He will sit poring\n",
      "over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one\n",
      "drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think\n",
      "Lady Russell would like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell could not help laughing.  \"Upon my word,\" said she,\n",
      "\"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\n",
      "admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact\n",
      "as I may call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person\n",
      "who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.\n",
      "I wish he may be induced to call here.  And when he does, Mary,\n",
      "you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined\n",
      "not to judge him beforehand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will not like him, I will answer for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with animation\n",
      "of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see.\n",
      "His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,\n",
      "has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short\n",
      "in the midst of the Elliot countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,\n",
      "there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had been\n",
      "greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved,\n",
      "he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature\n",
      "from what he had been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa;\n",
      "and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\n",
      "from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,\n",
      "on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\n",
      "or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He had talked of going\n",
      "down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick\n",
      "to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick\n",
      "seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both\n",
      "occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.\n",
      "Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might\n",
      "be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\n",
      "in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,\n",
      "without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.\n",
      "Captain Benwick came not, however.  He was either less disposed for it\n",
      "than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him\n",
      "a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy\n",
      "of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,\n",
      "bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise\n",
      "of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained with Louisa;\n",
      "but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,\n",
      "when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.\n",
      "Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,\n",
      "nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast\n",
      "as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,\n",
      "whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\n",
      "from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side\n",
      "was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk\n",
      "and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,\n",
      "bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys\n",
      "were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire,\n",
      "which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise\n",
      "of the others.  Charles and Mary also came in, of course,\n",
      "during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects\n",
      "to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,\n",
      "talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children\n",
      "on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed\n",
      "such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,\n",
      "which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove,\n",
      "who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,\n",
      "again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded\n",
      "a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,\n",
      "with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,\n",
      "nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\n",
      "at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of her\n",
      "being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters\n",
      "went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her\n",
      "and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,\n",
      "for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I shall remember, in future,\" said Lady Russell, as soon as\n",
      "they were reseated in the carriage, \"not to call at Uppercross\n",
      "in the Christmas holidays.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;\n",
      "and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort\n",
      "rather than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards,\n",
      "was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through\n",
      "the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,\n",
      "amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,\n",
      "the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless\n",
      "clink of pattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises\n",
      "which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose\n",
      "under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,\n",
      "though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be\n",
      "so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,\n",
      "though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view\n",
      "of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish\n",
      "of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,\n",
      "however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her\n",
      "when she arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles\n",
      "of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.\n",
      "Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; had called\n",
      "a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If Elizabeth\n",
      "and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains\n",
      "to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,\n",
      "as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was very wonderful\n",
      "if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable\n",
      "curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment\n",
      "she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had\n",
      "no wish to see.\"  She had a great wish to see him.  If he really sought\n",
      "to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven\n",
      "for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,\n",
      "but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,\n",
      "which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove\n",

      "Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,\n",
      "a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;\n",
      "and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment\n",
      "of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, \"Oh! when shall I\n",
      "leave you again?\"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,\n",
      "in the welcome she received, did her good.  Her father and sister\n",
      "were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,\n",
      "and met her with kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they\n",
      "sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles\n",
      "were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she would\n",
      "pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others\n",
      "was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,\n",
      "and she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination\n",
      "to listen to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being\n",
      "deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,\n",
      "they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be\n",
      "all their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:\n",
      "it was all Bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered\n",
      "their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly\n",
      "the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages\n",
      "over all the others which they had either seen or heard of,\n",
      "and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,\n",
      "or the taste of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was\n",
      "exceedingly sought after.  Everybody was wanting to visit them.\n",
      "They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were\n",
      "perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father\n",
      "and sister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh\n",
      "that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see\n",
      "nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,\n",
      "should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;\n",
      "and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open\n",
      "the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room\n",
      "to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,\n",
      "who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of\n",
      "between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not all which they had to make them happy.\n",
      "They had Mr Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.\n",
      "He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.\n",
      "He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath\n",
      "in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of\n",
      "Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him,\n",
      "though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able\n",
      "to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,\n",
      "and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card\n",
      "in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,\n",
      "and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,\n",
      "such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received\n",
      "as a relation again, that their former good understanding\n",
      "was completely re-established.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away\n",
      "all the appearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated\n",
      "in misapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of\n",
      "throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,\n",
      "but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint\n",
      "of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\n",
      "and the family honours, he was quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted\n",
      "of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,\n",
      "were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.\n",
      "He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct\n",
      "must refute it.  He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;\n",
      "and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity\n",
      "of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation\n",
      "and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of\n",
      "much extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself;\n",
      "but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly\n",
      "respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,\n",
      "Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough\n",
      "Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted\n",
      "to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things\n",
      "relative to the marriage, which made a material difference\n",
      "in the discredit of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted\n",
      "also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.\n",
      "She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,\n",
      "accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.\n",
      "There had been the charm.  She had sought him.  Without that attraction,\n",
      "not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,\n",
      "moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.\n",
      "Here was a great deal to soften the business.  A very fine woman\n",
      "with a large fortune, in love with him!  Sir Walter seemed to admit it\n",
      "as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance\n",
      "in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,\n",
      "evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they\n",
      "gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof\n",
      "of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being\n",
      "on intimate terms in Camden Place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances,\n",
      "large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.\n",
      "She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant\n",
      "or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\n",
      "but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had\n",
      "the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,\n",
      "in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years,\n",
      "to be well received by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain\n",
      "by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.\n",
      "In all probability he was already the richer of the two,\n",
      "and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.\n",
      "A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,\n",
      "why should it be an object to him?  She could only offer one solution;\n",
      "it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been\n",
      "a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him\n",
      "a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,\n",
      "he might mean to pay his addresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly\n",
      "very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character\n",
      "might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,\n",
      "and when very young himself.  How her temper and understanding\n",
      "might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\n",
      "was another concern and rather a fearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish\n",
      "that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth\n",
      "were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so,\n",
      "and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent\n",
      "by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits\n",
      "were talked of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without\n",
      "being much attended to.  \"Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.\n",
      "They did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.\"  They could not listen\n",
      "to her description of him.  They were describing him themselves;\n",
      "Sir Walter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlike\n",
      "appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,\n",
      "his sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being\n",
      "very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;\n",
      "nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\n",
      "almost every feature for the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think\n",
      "that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when\n",
      "they last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return\n",
      "the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.  He did not mean\n",
      "to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men,\n",
      "and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of\n",
      "the whole evening.  \"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be\n",
      "introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\"\n",
      "and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,\n",
      "as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot\n",
      "spoke of her as \"a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known\n",
      "in Camden Place,\" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.\n",
      "Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be\n",
      "an excessively pretty woman, beautiful.  \"He longed to see her.\n",
      "He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\n",
      "he was continually passing in the streets.  The worst of Bath was\n",
      "the number of its plain women.  He did not mean to say that there were\n",
      "no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.\n",
      "He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face\n",
      "would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,\n",
      "as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted\n",
      "eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being\n",
      "a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty morning,\n",
      "to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand\n",
      "could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were\n",
      "a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!\n",
      "they were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\n",
      "It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\n",
      "tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.\n",
      "He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis\n",
      "(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing\n",
      "that every woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be\n",
      "upon Colonel Wallis.\"  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed\n",
      "to escape, however.  His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting\n",
      "that Colonel Wallis's companion might have as good a figure\n",
      "as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is Mary looking?\" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.\n",
      "\"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not\n",
      "happen every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has been\n",
      "in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,\n",
      "and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,\n",
      "or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door\n",
      "suspended everything.  \"A knock at the door! and so late!\n",
      "It was ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine\n",
      "in Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way home\n",
      "to ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.\n",
      "Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock.\"  Mrs Clay was right.\n",
      "With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,\n",
      "Mr Elliot was ushered into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.\n",
      "Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,\n",
      "and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,\n",
      "but \"he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\n",
      "nor her friend had taken cold the day before,\" &c. &c; which was\n",
      "all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part\n",
      "must follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\"\n",
      "(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and\n",
      "blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features\n",
      "which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement\n",
      "at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware\n",
      "of who she was.  He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished\n",
      "than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity\n",
      "he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated\n",
      "to be received as an acquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking\n",
      "as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,\n",
      "and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,\n",
      "so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them\n",
      "in excellence to only one person's manners.  They were not the same,\n",
      "but they were, perhaps, equally good.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.\n",
      "There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes\n",
      "were enough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions,\n",
      "his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all\n",
      "the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could,\n",
      "he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions\n",
      "respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\n",
      "of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;\n",
      "to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that\n",
      "he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.\n",
      "She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.\n",
      "His regret increased as he listened.  He had spent his whole\n",
      "solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,\n",
      "mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,\n",
      "longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion\n",
      "of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.\n",
      "If he had but asked who the party were!  The name of Musgrove would\n",
      "have told him enough.  \"Well, it would serve to cure him of\n",
      "an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,\n",
      "which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal\n",
      "of its being very ungenteel to be curious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,\" said he,\n",
      "\"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,\n",
      "are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings\n",
      "in the world.  The folly of the means they often employ\n",
      "is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:\n",
      "he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,\n",
      "and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.\n",
      "\n",
      "His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene\n",
      "she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.\n",
      "Having alluded to \"an accident,\"  he must hear the whole.\n",
      "When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,\n",
      "but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.\n",
      "She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish\n",
      "of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern\n",
      "for what she must have suffered in witnessing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-\n",
      "piece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman\n",
      "was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,\n",
      "before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.\n",

      "in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,\n",
      "when she had been at home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast\n",
      "the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence\n",
      "on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay\n",
      "to have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself\n",
      "at all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,\n",
      "\"That must not be any reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.\n",

      "to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.\n",
      "Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;\n",
      "but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\n",
      "in her sister.  The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,\n",
      "and promise to stay.\n",

      "In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be\n",

      "he thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,\n",
      "her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been\n",
      "using any thing in particular?\"  \"No, nothing.\"  \"Merely Gowland,\"\n",
      "he supposed.  \"No, nothing at all.\"  \"Ha! he was surprised at that;\"\n",
      "and added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;\n",
      "you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,\n",
      "the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been\n",
      "using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.\n",
      "You see how it has carried away her freckles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise\n",
      "might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne\n",
      "that the freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must\n",
      "take its chance.  The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,\n",
      "if Elizabeth were also to marry.  As for herself, she might always\n",
      "command a home with Lady Russell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\n",
      "on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs Clay\n",
      "in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation\n",
      "to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath\n",
      "who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has\n",
      "a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,\n",
      "or more indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were\n",

      "the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,\n",
      "as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, \"Can this be Mr Elliot?\"\n",
      "and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\n",
      "or estimable man.  Everything united in him; good understanding,\n",
      "correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.\n",
      "He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,\n",
      "without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune,\n",
      "without display; he judged for himself in everything essential,\n",
      "without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.\n",
      "He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits\n",
      "or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,\n",
      "with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value\n",
      "for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of\n",
      "fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.\n",
      "She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis\n",
      "said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness\n",
      "to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his\n",
      "thinking of a second choice.  Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot\n",
      "outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she\n",
      "and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;\n",
      "and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell\n",
      "should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require\n",
      "more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.\n",
      "In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,\n",
      "at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,\n",
      "and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,\n",
      "to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process\n",
      "in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring\n",
      "in the heyday of youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it,\n",
      "and at last to mention \"Elizabeth.\"  Lady Russell listened, and looked,\n",
      "and made only this cautious reply:--\"Elizabeth! very well;\n",
      "time will explain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,\n",
      "felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing at present.\n",
      "In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit\n",
      "of such general observance as \"Miss Elliot,\" that any particularity\n",
      "of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,\n",
      "it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.\n",
      "A little delay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact,\n",
      "Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that\n",
      "she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;\n",
      "for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed\n",
      "so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\n",
      "from the awful impression of its being dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "However it might end, he was without any question their\n",
      "pleasantest acquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him;\n",
      "and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,\n",
      "which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of,\n",
      "as herself.  They went through the particulars of their first meeting\n",
      "a great many times.  He gave her to understand that he had\n",
      "looked at her with some earnestness.  She knew it well;\n",
      "and she remembered another person's look also.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion\n",

      "it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly\n",
      "into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which\n",
      "she thought unworthy to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning\n",
      "announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\n",

      "of No.--, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples\n",

      "better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,\n",
      "and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;\n",
      "a wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple\n",

      "but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties\n",
      "of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\n",
      "by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,\n",
      "when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's\n",
      "at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.\n",
      "No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect\n",
      "had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot\n",
      "died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,\n",
      "and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend\n",
      "that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.\n",
      "How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted\n",
      "as cousins again, was the question:  and it was a question which,\n",
      "in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\n",
      "thought unimportant.  \"Family connexions were always worth preserving,\n",
      "good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,\n",
      "for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.\n",
      "She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her\n",
      "spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that\n",
      "the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any\n",
      "compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote\n",
      "a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,\n",
      "to his right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot\n",
      "could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,\n",
      "in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.\n",
      "\"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.\"\n",
      "The toils of the business were over, the sweets began.  They visited\n",
      "in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,\n",
      "and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might\n",
      "be most visible:  and \"Our cousins in Laura Place,\"--\"Our cousin,\n",
      "Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\" were talked of to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been\n",
      "very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\n",
      "they created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,\n",
      "accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired\n",
      "the name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer\n",
      "for everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain\n",
      "and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place\n",
      "but for her birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet\n",
      "\"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak\n",
      "her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing\n",
      "in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,\n",
      "as good company, as those who would collect good company around them,\n",
      "they had their value.  Anne smiled and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,\n",
      "well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\n",
      "that is what I call good company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are mistaken,\" said he gently, \"that is not good company;\n",
      "that is the best.  Good company requires only birth, education,\n",
      "and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.\n",
      "Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is\n",
      "by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,\n",
      "it will do very well.  My cousin Anne shakes her head.\n",
      "She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dear cousin\"\n",
      "(sitting down by her), \"you have a better right to be fastidious\n",
      "than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?\n",
      "Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society\n",
      "of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages\n",
      "of the connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it,\n",
      "that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,\n",
      "and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them\n",
      "will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)\n",
      "in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" sighed Anne, \"we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!\"\n",
      "then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,\n",
      "\"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\n",
      "to procure the acquaintance.  I suppose\" (smiling) \"I have more pride\n",
      "than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be\n",
      "so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may\n",
      "be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.\n",
      "In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,\n",
      "it might be as you say:  but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family\n",
      "will always be worth knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome\n",
      "which depends so entirely upon place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love your indignation,\" said he; \"it is very natural.\n",
      "But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here\n",
      "with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.\n",
      "You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish\n",
      "to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,\n",
      "would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem\n",
      "a little different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,\"\n",
      "(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)\n",
      "\"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that\n",
      "every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors,\n",
      "may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been\n",
      "lately occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;\n",
      "and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,\n",
      "she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience\n",
      "admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting\n",
      "great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.\n",

      "While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\n",

      "of a very different description.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her\n",
      "of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims\n",
      "on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,\n",
      "now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\n",
      "when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,\n",
      "grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,\n",
      "feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,\n",
      "of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;\n",
      "and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want\n",
      "of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,\n",
      "had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\n",
      "her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,\n",
      "was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all\n",
      "that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess's account\n",
      "brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant;\n",
      "and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs\n",
      "dreadfully involved.  She had had difficulties of every sort\n",
      "to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\n",
      "with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,\n",
      "had made her for the present a cripple.  She had come to Bath\n",
      "on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,\n",
      "living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself\n",
      "the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\n",
      "from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore\n",
      "lost no time in going.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,\n",
      "or what she intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.\n",
      "She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,\n",
      "and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings\n",
      "in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest\n",
      "in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes\n",
      "had its awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone\n",
      "since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person\n",
      "from what the other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne\n",
      "from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant\n",
      "little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,\n",
      "and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;\n",
      "and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,\n",
      "in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,\n",
      "infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee\n",
      "as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\n",
      "passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering\n",
      "former partialities and talking over old times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\n",
      "she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse\n",
      "and be cheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations\n",
      "of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions\n",
      "of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\n",
      "closed her heart or ruined her spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,\n",
      "and Anne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine\n",
      "a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been\n",
      "very fond of her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been\n",
      "used to affluence:  it was gone.  She had no child to connect her\n",
      "with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement\n",
      "of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.\n",
      "Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom\n",
      "behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\n",
      "assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,\n",
      "and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.\n",
      "Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had\n",
      "moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation\n",
      "and enjoyment.  How could it be?  She watched, observed, reflected,\n",
      "and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\n",
      "or of resignation only.  A submissive spirit might be patient,\n",
      "a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more;\n",
      "here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,\n",
      "that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment\n",
      "which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.\n",
      "It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend\n",
      "as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,\n",
      "it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits\n",
      "had nearly failed.  She could not call herself an invalid now,\n",
      "compared with her state on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed,\n",
      "been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,\n",
      "and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\n",
      "confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;\n",
      "and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having\n",
      "a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit\n",
      "to meet any extraordinary expense.  She had weathered it, however,\n",
      "and could truly say that it had done her good.  It had increased\n",
      "her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.\n",
      "She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested\n",
      "attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\n",
      "had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been\n",
      "particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,\n",
      "a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house\n",
      "when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.\n",
      "\"And she,\" said Mrs Smith, \"besides nursing me most admirably,\n",
      "has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I could\n",
      "use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;\n",
      "and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,\n",
      "pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,\n",
      "and which supply me with the means of doing a little good\n",
      "to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.\n",
      "She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those\n",
      "who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.\n",
      "She always takes the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open,\n",
      "you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,\n",
      "or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke\n",
      "thoroughly understands when to speak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent,\n",
      "sensible woman.  Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has\n",
      "a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her\n",
      "infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\n",
      "`the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.\n",
      "Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's\n",
      "leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate\n",
      "that is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one\n",
      "know one's species better.  One likes to hear what is going on,\n",
      "to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.\n",
      "To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,\n",
      "\"I can easily believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities,\n",
      "and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.\n",
      "Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!\n",
      "And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;\n",
      "for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\n",
      "most interesting or affecting.  What instances must pass before them\n",
      "of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,\n",
      "patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\n",
      "that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish\n",
      "the worth of volumes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may,\n",
      "though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.\n",
      "Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;\n",
      "but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength\n",
      "that appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience\n",
      "rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.\n",
      "There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately\"\n",
      "(speaking low and tremulously) \"there are so many who forget\n",
      "to think seriously till it is almost too late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been\n",
      "what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\n",
      "which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.\n",
      "It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,\n",
      "and soon added in a different tone--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,\n",
      "will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursing\n",
      "Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,\n",
      "fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report\n",
      "but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.\n",
      "She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all\n",
      "the high-priced things I have in hand now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence\n",
      "of such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary\n",
      "to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning\n",
      "from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple\n",
      "for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening\n",
      "in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.\n",
      "They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being\n",
      "kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship\n",
      "which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account\n",
      "with great alacrity--\"She was engaged to spend the evening\n",
      "with an old schoolfellow.\"  They were not much interested in anything\n",
      "relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,\n",
      "to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth\n",
      "was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Westgate Buildings!\" said he, \"and who is Miss Anne Elliot\n",
      "to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith;\n",
      "and who was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names\n",
      "are to be met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?\n",
      "That she is old and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,\n",
      "you have the most extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts\n",
      "other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations\n",
      "are inviting to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady\n",
      "till to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume,\n",
      "but that she may hope to see another day.  What is her age?  Forty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can\n",
      "put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time\n",
      "which will at once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath\n",
      "to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She sees nothing to blame in it,\" replied Anne; \"on the contrary,\n",
      "she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have\n",
      "called on Mrs Smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\n",
      "of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter.\n",
      "\"Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,\n",
      "but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known\n",
      "to convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!\n",
      "A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;\n",
      "a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names\n",
      "in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,\n",
      "and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\n",
      "of England and Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it\n",
      "advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,\n",
      "and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's\n",
      "not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect\n",
      "to her father prevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it\n",
      "to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow\n",
      "in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,\n",
      "and no surname of dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course\n",
      "she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.\n",
      "She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter\n",
      "and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves,\n",
      "but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,\n",
      "and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;\n",
      "and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,\n",
      "and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\n",
      "in order to wait on her.  Anne had the whole history of all that\n",
      "such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.  To her,\n",
      "its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of\n",
      "between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,\n",
      "and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.\n",
      "Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,\n",
      "sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.\n",
      "He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,\n",
      "mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meet even Lady Russell\n",
      "in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand\n",
      "so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated\n",
      "by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations\n",
      "which her friend meant to create.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.\n",
      "She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of\n",
      "his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\n",
      "which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,\n",
      "and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.\n",
      "She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject,\n",
      "she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,\n",
      "of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,\n",
      "supposing such attachment to be real and returned.  Anne heard her,\n",
      "and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,\n",
      "and gently shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell,\n",
      "\"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\n",

      "pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,\n",
      "I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.\n",
      "A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think\n",
      "it might be a very happy one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects\n",
      "I think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, \"I own that\n",
      "to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,\n",
      "the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying\n",
      "your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights,\n",
      "and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be\n",
      "the highest possible gratification to me.  You are your mother's self\n",
      "in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you\n",
      "such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing\n",
      "in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!\n",

      "at my time of life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,\n",
      "and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings\n",
      "this picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heart\n",
      "were bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been;\n",
      "of having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself;\n",
      "of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,\n",
      "her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.\n",
      "Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter\n",
      "to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment\n",
      "with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,\n",
      "what Anne did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking\n",
      "for himself brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch\n",
      "and of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away.  She never could accept him.\n",
      "And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\n",
      "save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities\n",
      "of such a case was against Mr Elliot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied\n",
      "that she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man,\n",
      "an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,\n",
      "seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all\n",
      "clear enough.  He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix\n",
      "on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would\n",
      "have been afraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past,\n",
      "if not the present.  The names which occasionally dropt\n",
      "of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,\n",
      "suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.\n",
      "She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling\n",
      "had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life\n",
      "(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,\n",
      "careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think\n",
      "very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,\n",
      "cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?\n",
      "How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.\n",
      "There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,\n",
      "at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.\n",
      "Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized the frank,\n",
      "the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.\n",
      "Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could\n",
      "so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\n",
      "or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind\n",
      "never varied, whose tongue never slipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers\n",
      "in her father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well,\n",
      "stood too well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some\n",
      "degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see\n",
      "what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet\n",
      "Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.\n",
      "\n",

      "It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,\n",
      "was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.\n",
      "She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.\n",
      "It was three weeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew\n",
      "that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be\n",
      "recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all\n",
      "very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary\n",

      "\"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know\n",
      "how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.\n",
      "You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,\n",
      "as you well know, affords little to write about.  We have had\n",
      "a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party\n",
      "all the holidays.  I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.\n",
      "The holidays, however, are over at last:  I believe no children ever had\n",
      "such long ones.  I am sure I had not.  The house was cleared yesterday,\n",
      "except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear\n",
      "they have never gone home.  Mrs Harville must be an odd mother\n",
      "to part with them so long.  I do not understand it.  They are\n",
      "not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to\n",
      "like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.\n",
      "What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt in Bath,\n",
      "with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.\n",
      "I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,\n",
      "except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.\n",
      "Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme\n",
      "as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.\n",
      "The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.\n",
      "We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,\n",
      "which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her;\n",
      "and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.\n",
      "I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted\n",
      "with him too; but I have my usual luck:  I am always out of the way\n",
      "when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family\n",
      "to be noticed.  What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying\n",
      "with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean to go away?  But perhaps\n",
      "if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.\n",
      "Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect my children\n",
      "to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House very well,\n",
      "for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the Crofts\n",
      "are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.\n",
      "Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility\n",
      "to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.\n",
      "I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,\n",
      "and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins me\n",
      "in love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,\n",

      "offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,\n",
      "addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to\n",
      "make my letter as long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill,\n",
      "and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.\n",
      "I shall be truly glad to have them back again.  Our neighbourhood\n",
      "cannot spare such a pleasant family.  But now for Louisa.\n",
      "I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.\n",
      "She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening\n",
      "we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised\n",
      "not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited\n",
      "as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?\n",
      "Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,\n",
      "and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer\n",
      "from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her\n",
      "before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.\n",
      "True, upon my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised\n",
      "at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.\n",
      "We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her\n",
      "marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;\n",
      "and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick\n",
      "is expected to-day.  Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal\n",
      "on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite\n",
      "with both.  Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her\n",
      "the better for having nursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth\n",
      "will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;\n",
      "I never could see anything of it.  And this is the end, you see,\n",
      "of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.\n",
      "How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always\n",
      "incomprehensible to me.  I hope he will be more agreeable now.\n",
      "Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better\n",
      "than marrying among the Hayters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared\n",
      "for the news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.\n",
      "Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful\n",
      "for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\n",
      "in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions\n",
      "of the moment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter\n",
      "wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,\n",
      "and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath\n",
      "as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had\n",
      "little curiosity beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,\n",
      "\"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gout and decrepitude!\" said Sir Walter.  \"Poor old gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have they any acquaintance here?\" asked Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's\n",
      "time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance\n",
      "in such a place as this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suspect,\" said Sir Walter coolly, \"that Admiral Croft\n",
      "will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.\n",
      "Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,\n",
      "we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\n",
      "she might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify;\n",
      "but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.\n",
      "We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.\n",
      "There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,\n",
      "I am told, are sailors.  The Crofts will associate with them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;\n",
      "when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,\n",
      "in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,\n",
      "Anne was at liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonder\n",
      "how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,\n",
      "had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.\n",
      "She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything\n",
      "akin to ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure\n",
      "that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited,\n",
      "joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,\n",
      "feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything\n",
      "that would not suit the other.  Their minds most dissimilar!\n",
      "Where could have been the attraction?  The answer soon presented itself.\n",
      "It had been in situation.  They had been thrown together several weeks;\n",
      "they had been living in the same small family party:  since Henrietta's\n",
      "coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,\n",
      "and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state,\n",
      "and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne\n",
      "had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing\n",
      "the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,\n",
      "they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\n",
      "dawning of tenderness toward herself.  She did not mean, however,\n",
      "to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary\n",
      "might have allowed.  She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\n",
      "young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\n",
      "received the same compliment.  He had an affectionate heart.\n",
      "He must love somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine\n",
      "naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.\n",
      "He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast\n",
      "for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;\n",
      "of course they had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of\n",
      "Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,\n",
      "and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt\n",
      "of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,\n",
      "might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to\n",
      "the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have\n",
      "influenced her fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible\n",
      "of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man,\n",
      "there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;\n",
      "and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing\n",
      "to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart\n",
      "beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks\n",
      "when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.\n",
      "She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.\n",
      "They were too much like joy, senseless joy!\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,\n",
      "it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.\n",
      "The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove\n",
      "was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,\n",
      "perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed\n",
      "of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more\n",
      "about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,\n",
      "and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,\n",
      "and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.\n",
      "They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.\n",
      "He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft\n",
      "seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk\n",
      "for her life to do him good.  Anne saw them wherever she went.\n",
      "Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,\n",
      "and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.\n",
      "Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture\n",
      "of happiness to her.  She always watched them as long as she could,\n",
      "delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,\n",
      "as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted\n",
      "to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\n",
      "an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation\n",
      "when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft\n",
      "looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;\n",
      "but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days\n",
      "after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,\n",
      "or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town,\n",
      "and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street\n",
      "she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing\n",
      "by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,\n",
      "in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have\n",
      "passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him\n",
      "before she could catch his notice.  When he did perceive and\n",
      "acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness\n",
      "and good humour.  \"Ha! is it you?  Thank you, thank you.\n",
      "This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you see,\n",
      "staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without stopping.\n",
      "But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.\n",
      "Did you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must be,\n",
      "to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\n",
      "old cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen\n",
      "stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks\n",
      "and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,\n",
      "which they certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!\"\n",
      "(laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it.\n",
      "Well,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere\n",
      "for you, or with you?  Can I be of any use?\"\n",

      "this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.\n",
      "He was courting her week after week.  The only wonder was,\n",
      "what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;\n",
      "then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\n",

      "There is something about Frederick more to our taste.\"\n",

      "of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,\n",
      "not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best\n",
      "that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,\n",

      "\n",

      "While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing\n",
      "his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth\n",

      "he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were\n",
      "in Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to\n",
      "make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it\n",
      "very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being\n",
      "conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting\n",
      "at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,\n",

      "\n",
      "Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold\n",
      "more than four with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother;\n",
      "consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\n",
      "for all the three Camden Place ladies.  There could be no doubt\n",
      "as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none,\n",
      "but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\n",
      "between the other two.  The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was\n",
      "most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also\n",
      "a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all,\n",
      "and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne's;\n",
      "and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\n",
      "to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them\n",
      "with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were\n",
      "obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay\n",
      "had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,\n",
      "that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the thickest.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party\n",
      "in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,\n",

      "Captain Wentworth walking down the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that\n",
      "she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable\n",
      "and absurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;\n",
      "it was all confusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded\n",
      "back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,\n",
      "and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street\n",
      "on a commission of Mrs Clay's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;\n",
      "she wanted to see if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself\n",
      "of another motive?  Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.\n",
      "She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always\n",
      "so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other\n",
      "of being worse than it was.  She would see if it rained.\n",
      "She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of\n",
      "Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,\n",
      "evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined\n",
      "a little below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck\n",
      "and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;\n",
      "he looked quite red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,\n",
      "she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.\n",
      "She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.\n",
      "All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects\n",
      "of strong surprise were over with her.  Still, however,\n",
      "she had enough to feel!  It was agitation, pain, pleasure,\n",
      "a something between delight and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner\n",
      "was embarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,\n",
      "or anything so certainly as embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.\n",
      "Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,\n",
      "much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible\n",
      "of his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being\n",
      "so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable\n",
      "portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.\n",
      "Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There was consciousness\n",
      "of some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if he had been\n",
      "suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,\n",
      "of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look\n",
      "of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was\n",
      "Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth\n",
      "would not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him,\n",
      "that there was complete internal recognition on each side;\n",
      "she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,\n",

      "very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.\n",
      "It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,\n",
      "and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd\n",
      "in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey\n",
      "Miss Elliot.  At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but\n",
      "by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them.\n",

      "\n",
      "She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating\n",

      "of the privileged relation and friend.  He came in with eagerness,\n",
      "appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,\n",
      "was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away\n",
      "without further loss of time and before the rain increased;\n",
      "and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! so do I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.\n",

      "Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have\n",
      "walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.\n",

      "praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,\n",
      "and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now\n",
      "she could think only of Captain Wentworth.  She could not understand\n",
      "his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much\n",
      "from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,\n",
      "she could not be quite herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!\n",
      "she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long\n",
      "he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not\n",
      "recollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was more probable\n",
      "that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as every body was\n",
      "to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood\n",
      "see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would it all be?\n",

      "on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\n",
      "the greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him,\n",
      "many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.\n",
      "She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea\n",
      "of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was\n",
      "not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they\n",
      "were nearly opposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time,\n",
      "anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,\n",
      "though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew\n",
      "was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of\n",
      "Lady Russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--\n",
      "of her being, in short, intently observing him.  She could thoroughly\n",
      "comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's mind,\n",
      "the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment\n",
      "she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him,\n",

      "either at her friend or herself.  The part which provoked her most,\n",
      "was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have\n",
      "lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the rooms,\n",
      "where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough\n",
      "for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the\n",
      "elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting\n",
      "more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,\n",
      "sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because\n",
      "her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.\n",
      "It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.\n",
      "Of course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one,\n",
      "and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have\n",
      "a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should\n",
      "be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over\n",
      "courage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,\n",
      "Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened\n",
      "by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;\n",
      "but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,\n",
      "with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.\n",
      "Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.\n",

      "Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest\n",
      "of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple\n",
      "must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires\n",
      "in the Octagon Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door\n",
      "opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was\n",
      "the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.\n",
      "He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle \"How do you do?\"\n",
      "brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries\n",
      "in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.\n",
      "Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing\n",
      "of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed\n",
      "right to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth\n",
      "caught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject;\n",
      "and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended\n",
      "that her father had judged so well as to give him that\n",
      "simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time\n",
      "by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\n",
      "This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet\n",
      "better than nothing, and her spirits improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,\n",
      "their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,\n",
      "that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;\n",
      "he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,\n",
      "with a little smile, a little glow, he said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must have\n",
      "suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you\n",
      "at the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She assured him that she had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a frightful hour,\" said he, \"a frightful day!\" and he\n",
      "passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still\n",
      "too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,\n",
      "\"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences\n",
      "which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.\n",
      "When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be\n",
      "the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea\n",
      "of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would be\n",
      "a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles\n",
      "and good temper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \"but there, I think,\n",
      "ends the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice\n",
      "over every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties\n",
      "to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.\n",
      "The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,\n",
      "only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort.\n",
      "All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;\n",
      "more than perhaps--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him\n",
      "some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks\n",
      "and fixing her eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however,\n",
      "he proceeded thus--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,\n",
      "and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove\n",
      "as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,\n",
      "but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, a reading man;\n",
      "and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her\n",
      "with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude,\n",
      "had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him,\n",
      "it would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.\n",
      "It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,\n",
      "untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,\n",
      "in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!\n",
      "Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her\n",
      "was indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such\n",
      "a devotion of the heart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,\n",
      "or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,\n",
      "in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,\n",
      "and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless\n",
      "slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,\n",
      "had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,\n",
      "and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things\n",
      "in a moment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;\n",
      "and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,\n",
      "and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated\n",
      "so far as to say--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well\n",
      "was quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\n",
      "to be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.\n",
      "She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.\n",
      "The country round Lyme is very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal;\n",
      "and the more I saw, the more I found to admire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should very much like to see Lyme again,\" said Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found\n",
      "anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress\n",
      "you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!\n",
      "I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been\n",
      "strong disgust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The last hours were certainly very painful,\" replied Anne;\n",
      "\"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.\n",
      "One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,\n",
      "unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was\n",
      "by no means the case at Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress\n",
      "during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal\n",
      "of enjoyment.  So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little,\n",
      "that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty\n",
      "at Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections),\n",
      "\"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared\n",
      "for whom they were waiting.  \"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\"\n",
      "was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible\n",
      "with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward\n",
      "to meet her.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot\n",
      "and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,\n",
      "advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was\n",
      "a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.\n",
      "She was divided from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting,\n",
      "almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,\n",
      "but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!\n",
      "She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings\n",
      "towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;\n",
      "and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful\n",
      "civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.\n",
      "She was in good humour with all.  She had received ideas which\n",
      "disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,\n",
      "as being less happy than herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back\n",
      "from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw\n",
      "that he was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into\n",
      "the Concert Room.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt\n",
      "a moment's regret.  But \"they should meet again.  He would look for her,\n",
      "he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,\n",
      "perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.  She was in need of\n",
      "a little interval for recollection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party\n",
      "was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,\n",
      "and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence\n",
      "in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,\n",
      "and disturb as many people as they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\n",
      "Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back\n",
      "of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for\n",
      "which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be\n",
      "an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison\n",
      "between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity,\n",
      "of the other all generous attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.\n",
      "Her happiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;\n",
      "but she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of\n",
      "the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took\n",
      "a hasty range over it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions,\n",
      "and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see\n",
      "in only one light.  His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority,\n",
      "an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder\n",
      "at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;\n",
      "sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes\n",
      "and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had\n",
      "a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,\n",
      "were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship\n",
      "and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.  Yes, some share of\n",
      "the tenderness of the past.  She could not contemplate the change\n",
      "as implying less.  He must love her.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied\n",
      "and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;\n",
      "and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,\n",
      "without even trying to discern him.  When their places were determined on,\n",
      "and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see\n",
      "if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;\n",
      "her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,\n",
      "she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:\n",
      "Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,\n",
      "with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.\n",
      "Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object\n",
      "of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\n",
      "of the evening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for\n",
      "the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,\n",
      "and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,\n",
      "at least during the first act.  Towards the close of it,\n",
      "in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained\n",
      "the words of the song to Mr Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words,\n",
      "for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,\n",
      "but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend\n",
      "to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.\n",
      "You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\n",
      "these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,\n",
      "comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more\n",
      "of your ignorance.  Here is complete proof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be\n",
      "examined by a real proficient.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,\"\n",
      "replied he, \"without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;\n",
      "and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\n",
      "to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished\n",
      "for modesty to be natural in any other woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are\n",
      "to have next,\" turning to the bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance\n",
      "with your character than you are aware of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since\n",
      "I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of\n",
      "in my own family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you\n",
      "described by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted\n",
      "with you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,\n",
      "accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.\n",
      "No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been\n",
      "described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,\n",
      "is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered,\n",
      "and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.  He delighted in being asked,\n",
      "but he would not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention\n",
      "no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.\n",
      "He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot\n",
      "as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited\n",
      "the warmest curiosity to know her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\n",
      "partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,\n",
      "Captain Wentworth's brother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot's company,\n",
      "but she had not courage to ask the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me.\n",
      "Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,\n",
      "I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she\n",
      "received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds\n",
      "immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.\n",
      "Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A well-looking man,\" said Sir Walter, \"a very well-looking man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple.  \"More air\n",
      "than one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth;\n",
      "Captain Wentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant\n",
      "in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught\n",
      "the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing\n",
      "among a cluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him,\n",
      "his seemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.\n",
      "It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she\n",
      "dared observe, he did not look again:  but the performance\n",
      "was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\n",
      "to the orchestra and look straight forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could not have\n",
      "come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:\n",
      "but she would rather have caught his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer\n",
      "any inclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change;\n",
      "and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them\n",
      "did decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who\n",
      "did not choose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell;\n",
      "but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,\n",
      "whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from\n",
      "conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.\n",
      "She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\n",
      "at a distance, but he never came.  The anxious interval\n",
      "wore away unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again,\n",
      "benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure\n",
      "or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give\n",
      "delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.\n",
      "To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.\n",
      "She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth\n",
      "once more, without the interchange of one friendly look.\n",
      "\n",
      "In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which\n",
      "was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,\n",
      "and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner\n",
      "not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,\n",
      "and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to place herself\n",
      "much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,\n",
      "much more within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so,\n",
      "without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;\n",
      "but still she did it, and not with much happier effect;\n",
      "though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\n",
      "in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench\n",
      "before the concert closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth\n",
      "was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw her too;\n",
      "yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees\n",
      "came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt that something\n",
      "must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The difference\n",
      "between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room\n",
      "was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father,\n",
      "of Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?\n",
      "He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain\n",
      "Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;\n",
      "and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.\n",
      "Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well,\n",
      "and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance\n",
      "improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked\n",
      "for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down\n",
      "towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;\n",
      "when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.\n",
      "It came from Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to,\n",
      "to explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have\n",
      "a general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse;\n",
      "but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;\n",
      "and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look\n",
      "as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,\n",
      "in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.  \"He must wish her good night;\n",
      "he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck\n",
      "by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" he replied impressively, \"there is nothing worth my staying for;\"\n",
      "and he was gone directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.\n",
      "Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it\n",
      "a week ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.\n",
      "But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.\n",
      "How was such jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?\n",
      "How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,\n",
      "would he ever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think\n",
      "of Mr Elliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\n",
      "of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home\n",
      "at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid\n",
      "Mr Elliot was almost a first object.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of\n",
      "the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,\n",
      "perhaps compassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\n",
      "circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which\n",
      "he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,\n",
      "by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether\n",
      "very extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.\n",
      "How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,\n",
      "was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;\n",
      "and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,\n",
      "her affection would be his for ever.  Their union, she believed,\n",
      "could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,\n",
      "could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne\n",
      "was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.\n",
      "It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning\n",
      "particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her,\n",
      "though it had been an appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections\n",
      "of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\n",
      "and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tell\n",
      "she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,\n",
      "and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had\n",
      "already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,\n",
      "rather more of the general success and produce of the evening\n",
      "than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars\n",
      "of the company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath\n",
      "was well know by name to Mrs Smith.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The little Durands were there, I conclude,\" said she, \"with their mouths\n",
      "open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.\n",
      "They never miss a concert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were\n",
      "in the room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,\n",
      "with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know.  I do not think they were.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses,\n",
      "I know; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your own circle;\n",
      "for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,\n",
      "round the orchestra, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me\n",
      "in every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses\n",
      "to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,\n",
      "for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen\n",
      "very little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.\n",
      "There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,\n",
      "and this you had.  You were a large party in yourselves,\n",
      "and you wanted nothing beyond.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious\n",
      "while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,\n",
      "that the object only had been deficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you\n",
      "had a pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see\n",
      "how the hours passed:  that you had always something agreeable\n",
      "to listen to.  In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne half smiled and said, \"Do you see that in my eye?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\n",
      "in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\n",
      "in the world, the person who interests you at this present time\n",
      "more than all the rest of the world put together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She could say nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,\n",
      "\"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness\n",
      "in coming to me this morning.  It is really very good of you\n",
      "to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands\n",
      "upon your time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment and\n",
      "confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine\n",
      "how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.\n",
      "After another short silence--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?\n",
      "Does he know that I am in Bath?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot!\" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's reflection\n",
      "shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught it instantaneously;\n",
      "and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,\n",
      "more composedly, \"Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been a good deal acquainted with him,\" replied Mrs Smith, gravely,\n",
      "\"but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.\n",
      "Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To confess the truth,\" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual\n",
      "air of cheerfulness, \"that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.\n",
      "I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.\n",
      "He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,\n",
      "my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,\n",
      "of course it is done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness\n",
      "to be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect\n",
      "that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,\n",
      "a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.\n",
      "I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.\n",
      "You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation.  If in that light\n",
      "there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,\n",
      "I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.\n",
      "I ought to have waited for official information,  But now, my dear\n",
      "Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.\n",
      "Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to\n",
      "think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on\n",
      "Mr Elliot's good fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Anne, \"nor next week, nor next, nor next.\n",
      "I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\n",
      "will be settled any week.  I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.\n",
      "I should like to know why you imagine I am?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,\n",
      "shook her head, and exclaimed--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew\n",
      "what you were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel,\n",
      "when the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know,\n",
      "we women never mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us,\n",
      "that every man is refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?\n",
      "Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for\n",
      "my former friend.  Where can you look for a more suitable match?\n",
      "Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?\n",
      "Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am sure you hear nothing but good of him\n",
      "from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above\n",
      "half a year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\n",
      "to any one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly,\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.\n",
      "Do not forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to be\n",
      "a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,\n",
      "which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements\n",
      "of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.\n",
      "Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of course,\n",
      "he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss Elliot,\n",
      "I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense\n",
      "to understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be\n",
      "shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters,\n",
      "and safe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not be\n",
      "misled by others to his ruin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Anne, \"I can readily believe all that of my cousin.\n",
      "He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open\n",
      "to dangerous impressions.  I consider him with great respect.\n",
      "I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,\n",
      "to do otherwise.  But I have not known him long; and he is not a man,\n",
      "I think, to be known intimately soon.  Will not this manner\n",
      "of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?\n",
      "Surely this must be calm enough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.\n",
      "Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine\n",
      "he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you\n",
      "I shall not.  I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which\n",
      "you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert\n",
      "of last night might afford:  not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;\n",
      "but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly\n",
      "have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception\n",
      "of there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,\n",
      "and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,\n",
      "eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith\n",
      "should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have\n",
      "received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do tell me how it first came into your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much\n",
      "you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing\n",
      "in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;\n",
      "and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\n",
      "in the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And has it indeed been spoken of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\n",
      "you called yesterday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed\n",
      "no one in particular.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,\n",
      "had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way\n",
      "to let you in.  She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday;\n",
      "and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.\n",
      "She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.\n",
      "She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\"\n",
      "\"The whole history,\" repeated Anne, laughing.  \"She could not make\n",
      "a very long history, I think, of one such little article\n",
      "of unfounded news.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having\n",
      "this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you\n",
      "in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?\n",
      "Shall I take any message?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment,\n",
      "and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured\n",
      "to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you,\n",
      "I have nothing to trouble you with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not before he was married, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And--were you much acquainted?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Intimately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.\n",
      "I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.\n",
      "Was he at all such as he appears now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith's answer,\n",
      "given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;\n",
      "and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.\n",
      "They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,\" she cried, in her\n",
      "natural tone of cordiality, \"I beg your pardon for the short answers\n",
      "I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.\n",
      "I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.\n",
      "There were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates\n",
      "to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.\n",
      "Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,\n",
      "though there may be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined;\n",
      "I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted\n",
      "with Mr Elliot's real character.  Though I fully believe that,\n",
      "at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,\n",
      "there is no saying what may happen.  You might, some time or other,\n",
      "be differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore,\n",
      "now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart\n",
      "or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks\n",
      "only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty\n",
      "of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without\n",
      "risk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.\n",
      "Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,\n",
      "he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.\n",
      "He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.\n",
      "Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,\n",
      "and in a calmer manner, she added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry woman.\n",
      "But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.\n",
      "I will only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.\n",
      "He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him,\n",
      "and thought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed\n",
      "before our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too,\n",
      "became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained\n",
      "the highest opinion of him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not\n",
      "think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others,\n",
      "and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost\n",
      "always together.  We were principally in town, living in very good style.\n",
      "He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;\n",
      "he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do\n",
      "to support the appearance of a gentleman.  He had always a home\n",
      "with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.\n",
      "My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,\n",
      "would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse\n",
      "was open to him; I know that he often assisted him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,\"\n",
      "said Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity.\n",
      "It must have been about the same time that he became known to\n",
      "my father and sister.  I never knew him myself; I only heard of him;\n",
      "but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to\n",
      "my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,\n",
      "which I never could quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed\n",
      "to announce a different sort of man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it all, I know it all,\" cried Mrs Smith.  \"He had been\n",
      "introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him,\n",
      "but I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited\n",
      "and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,\n",
      "perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,\n",
      "I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors and againsts;\n",
      "I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though\n",
      "I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,\n",
      "indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,\n",
      "or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer\n",
      "any question you may wish to put.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay,\" said Anne, \"I have no particular enquiry to make about her.\n",
      "I have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should\n",
      "like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight\n",
      "my father's acquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed\n",
      "to take very kind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr Elliot,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"at that period of his life,\n",
      "had one object in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker\n",
      "process than the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.\n",
      "He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;\n",
      "and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course\n",
      "I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities\n",
      "and invitations, were designing a match between the heir\n",
      "and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match\n",
      "should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.\n",
      "That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.\n",
      "He told me the whole story.  He had no concealments with me.\n",
      "It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,\n",
      "my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;\n",
      "and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father\n",
      "and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought\n",
      "very affectionately of the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, \"you sometimes\n",
      "spoke of me to Mr Elliot?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,\n",
      "and vouch for your being a very different creature from--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She checked herself just in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,\"\n",
      "cried Anne.  \"This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.\n",
      "I could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where\n",
      "dear self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon;\n",
      "I have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?\n",
      "The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes\n",
      "to his character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.  \"Oh! those things are too common.\n",
      "When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money\n",
      "is too common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young,\n",
      "and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,\n",
      "gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.\n",
      "I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me\n",
      "other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible\n",
      "in what Mr Elliot was doing.  `To do the best for himself,'\n",
      "passed as a duty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But was not she a very low woman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money,\n",
      "was all that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather\n",
      "had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman,\n",
      "had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,\n",
      "thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him;\n",
      "and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,\n",
      "with respect to her birth.  All his caution was spent in being secured\n",
      "of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.\n",
      "Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation\n",
      "in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.\n",
      "His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour\n",
      "of the family he held as cheap as dirt.  I have often heard him declare,\n",
      "that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his\n",
      "for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;\n",
      "but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say\n",
      "on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof,\n",
      "for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne.  \"You have asserted\n",
      "nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.\n",
      "This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.\n",
      "I am more curious to know why he should be so different now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary;\n",
      "stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\n",
      "going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box\n",
      "which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.\n",
      "The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it\n",
      "as she unlocked it, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;\n",
      "a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.\n",
      "The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him\n",
      "before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.\n",
      "But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;\n",
      "and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others\n",
      "still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,\n",
      "while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.\n",
      "Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little\n",
      "satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document\n",
      "of former intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad\n",
      "that I can produce it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the letter, directed to \"Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,\"\n",
      "and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers me.\n",
      "I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have\n",
      "lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.\n",
      "At present, believe me, I have no need of your services,\n",
      "being in cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.\n",
      "They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them\n",
      "this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,\n",
      "to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.\n",
      "The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;\n",
      "he is quite fool enough.  If he does, however, they will leave me in peace,\n",
      "which may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse\n",
      "than last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of Walter\n",
      "I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me\n",
      "with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,\n",
      "to be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;\n",
      "and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot\n",
      "the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.\n",
      "But it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.\n",
      "Can any thing be stronger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\n",
      "of finding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollect\n",
      "that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,\n",
      "that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,\n",
      "that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,\n",
      "before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\n",
      "which she had been meditating over, and say--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing\n",
      "you were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you really?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,\n",
      "and I will shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again,\n",
      "but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what\n",
      "he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.\n",
      "He truly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family\n",
      "are very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority:\n",
      "his friend Colonel Wallis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;\n",
      "it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream\n",
      "is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\n",
      "is easily moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis\n",
      "of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,\n",
      "in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;\n",
      "but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom\n",
      "he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.\n",
      "She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all\n",
      "to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you,\n",
      "very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday evening, my good friend\n",
      "Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.\n",
      "When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was\n",
      "not romancing so much as you supposed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.\n",
      "Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account\n",
      "for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.\n",
      "That was all prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on\n",
      "the most friendly terms when I arrived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information\n",
      "in such a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\n",
      "of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,\n",
      "can hardly have much truth left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of\n",
      "the general credit due, by listening to some particulars\n",
      "which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.\n",
      "Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.  He had seen you\n",
      "indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without\n",
      "knowing it to be you.  So says my historian, at least.  Is this true?\n",
      "Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,'\n",
      "to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.\n",
      "I happened to be at Lyme.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, \"grant my friend the credit\n",
      "due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you then\n",
      "at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\n",
      "to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,\n",
      "and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive\n",
      "in his visits there.  But there was another, and an earlier,\n",
      "which I will now explain.  If there is anything in my story which you know\n",
      "to be either false or improbable, stop me.  My account states,\n",
      "that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you,\n",
      "whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter\n",
      "as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),\n",
      "and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,\n",
      "handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation\n",
      "and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance,\n",
      "of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise\n",
      "that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,\n",
      "and she continued--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,\n",
      "long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye\n",
      "upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then\n",
      "visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest\n",
      "in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath\n",
      "for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,\n",
      "Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,\n",
      "and the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand,\n",
      "that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions\n",
      "as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion\n",
      "he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money\n",
      "as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\n",
      "or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\n",
      "upon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on\n",
      "before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.\n",
      "He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess,\n",
      "therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be\n",
      "very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution\n",
      "of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here\n",
      "for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,\n",
      "and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\n",
      "of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady\n",
      "if he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends\n",
      "as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist\n",
      "in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis\n",
      "was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.\n",
      "Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,\n",
      "as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was\n",
      "his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival\n",
      "added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.\n",
      "He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way,\n",
      "called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.\n",
      "You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,\n",
      "perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Anne, \"you tell me nothing which does not accord with\n",
      "what I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive\n",
      "in the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\n",
      "must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.\n",
      "I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,\n",
      "who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.\n",
      "I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.\n",
      "I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability\n",
      "of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger\n",
      "to be lessening or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lessening, I understand,\" replied Mrs Smith.  \"He thinks Mrs Clay\n",
      "afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed\n",
      "as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absent\n",
      "some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure\n",
      "while she holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea,\n",
      "as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles\n",
      "when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.\n",
      "A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;\n",
      "but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  `Why, to be sure,\n",
      "ma'am,' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'\n",
      "And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,\n",
      "is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.\n",
      "She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;\n",
      "and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have\n",
      "some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through\n",
      "Mrs Wallis's recommendation?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very glad to know all this,\" said Anne, after a little\n",
      "thoughtfulness.  \"It will be more painful to me in some respects\n",
      "to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.\n",
      "My line of conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently\n",
      "a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had\n",
      "any better principle to guide him than selfishness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away\n",
      "from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest\n",
      "of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied\n",
      "against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation\n",
      "of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,\n",
      "if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,\n",
      "proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;\n",
      "very deficient both in justice and compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\n",
      "by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together,\n",
      "and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.\n",
      "Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender\n",
      "of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income\n",
      "had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first\n",
      "there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.\n",
      "From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been\n",
      "a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong\n",
      "understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,\n",
      "led by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by\n",
      "his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification\n",
      "of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,\n",
      "(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),\n",
      "and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself\n",
      "to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's\n",
      "probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and\n",
      "encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths\n",
      "accordingly had been ruined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.\n",
      "They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\n",
      "of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;\n",
      "but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\n",
      "was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,\n",
      "more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had\n",
      "appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,\n",
      "and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,\n",
      "in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such\n",
      "as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to\n",
      "without corresponding indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to\n",
      "urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same\n",
      "stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,\n",
      "under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference\n",
      "to any of the evils it might bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture\n",
      "of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,\n",
      "that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.  She had a great deal\n",
      "to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae\n",
      "of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been\n",
      "merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.\n",
      "Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only\n",
      "the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's\n",
      "usual state of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\n",
      "of particular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that\n",
      "some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been\n",
      "for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\n",
      "of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;\n",
      "and this property, though not large, would be enough to make\n",
      "her comparatively rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.\n",
      "Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,\n",
      "equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\n",
      "bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.\n",
      "She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,\n",
      "and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.\n",
      "This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.\n",
      "To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances,\n",
      "that a little trouble in the right place might do it,\n",
      "and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims,\n",
      "was hard to bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices\n",
      "with Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation\n",
      "of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;\n",
      "but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,\n",
      "since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,\n",
      "that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\n",
      "he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,\n",
      "as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,\n",
      "when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed\n",
      "the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope\n",
      "of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least\n",
      "the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but\n",
      "express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably\n",
      "in the beginning of their conversation.  \"She had seemed to recommend\n",
      "and praise him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" was Mrs Smith's reply, \"there was nothing else to be done.\n",
      "I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet\n",
      "have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,\n",
      "than if he had been your husband.  My heart bled for you,\n",
      "as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,\n",
      "and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.\n",
      "He was very unkind to his first wife.  They were wretched together.\n",
      "But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.\n",
      "I was willing to hope that you must fare better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\n",
      "of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea\n",
      "of the misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that\n",
      "she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such\n",
      "a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had\n",
      "disclosed all, too late?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;\n",
      "and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,\n",
      "which carried them through the greater part of the morning,\n",
      "was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\n",
      "everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.\n",

      "Chapter 22\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point,\n",
      "her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.\n",
      "There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as\n",
      "opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;\n",
      "and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief\n",
      "he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.\n",
      "Pity for him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.\n",
      "In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,\n",
      "she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned\n",
      "for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;\n",
      "for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,\n",
      "and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing\n",
      "how to avert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own\n",
      "knowledge of him.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward\n",
      "for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was\n",
      "a reward indeed springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her\n",
      "what no one else could have done.  Could the knowledge have\n",
      "been extended through her family?  But this was a vain idea.\n",
      "She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,\n",
      "and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure\n",
      "as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be\n",
      "in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;\n",
      "in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,\n",
      "escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them\n",
      "a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,\n",
      "and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth,\n",
      "with affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints;\n",
      "so Mrs Clay says, at least.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder\n",
      "for an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him;\n",
      "for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game\n",
      "to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found\n",
      "how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\n",
      "this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit\n",
      "an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to\n",
      "so much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so pleasantly.\n",
      "Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,\n",
      "to turn her eyes towards Anne.  \"Exactly like father and son!\n",
      "Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such\n",
      "ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions\n",
      "being beyond those of other men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear Miss Elliot!\" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,\n",
      "and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.\n",
      "I did invite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.\n",
      "When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park\n",
      "for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew\n",
      "such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival\n",
      "of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\n",
      "her prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate\n",
      "the sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,\n",
      "placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\n",
      "of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have\n",
      "done otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;\n",
      "and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.\n",
      "She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,\n",
      "but now she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference\n",
      "to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;\n",
      "and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,\n",
      "she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,\n",
      "or the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\n",
      "a remonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape\n",
      "all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\n",
      "to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,\n",
      "as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\n",
      "been gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded,\n",
      "and more cool, than she had been the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\n",
      "he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much\n",
      "to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:\n",
      "he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\n",
      "to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was\n",
      "not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard\n",
      "among the too-commanding claims of the others.  He little surmised\n",
      "that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,\n",
      "bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\n",
      "which were least excusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath\n",
      "the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part\n",
      "of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of\n",
      "his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.\n",
      "It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;\n",
      "but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,\n",
      "seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.\n",
      "It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\n",
      "on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources\n",
      "of mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was\n",
      "not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded\n",
      "for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's\n",
      "subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,\n",
      "and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone\n",
      "directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out\n",
      "on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which\n",
      "determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.\n",
      "She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk\n",
      "of spending the morning in Rivers Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have nothing to send but my love.\n",
      "Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,\n",
      "and pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself\n",
      "for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.\n",
      "Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\n",
      "You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.\n",
      "I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her\n",
      "at the concert.  Something so formal and arrange in her air!\n",
      "and she sits so upright!  My best love, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And mine,\" added Sir Walter.  \"Kindest regards.  And you may say,\n",
      "that I mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message;\n",
      "but I shall only leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair\n",
      "by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.\n",
      "If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;\n",
      "but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it be?\n",
      "Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,\n",
      "would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.\n",
      "After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard,\n",
      "and \"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove\" were ushered into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;\n",
      "but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry\n",
      "but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon\n",
      "as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived\n",
      "with an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth\n",
      "were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.\n",
      "They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were\n",
      "at the White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood;\n",
      "but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into\n",
      "the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,\n",
      "Anne could not draw upon Charles's brain for a regular history\n",
      "of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints\n",
      "of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,\n",
      "as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,\n",
      "and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,\n",
      "intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw\n",
      "a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme\n",
      "had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to\n",
      "come to Bath on business.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago;\n",
      "and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed\n",
      "coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it\n",
      "very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear\n",
      "to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two\n",
      "everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then,\n",
      "it had been taken up by his father and mother.  His mother had\n",
      "some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought\n",
      "a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes\n",
      "for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being\n",
      "his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy\n",
      "to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it\n",
      "by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night before.\n",
      "Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with\n",
      "Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough\n",
      "for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined\n",
      "such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\n",
      "the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,\n",
      "very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter\n",
      "had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\n",
      "who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that\n",
      "on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty\n",
      "of something more permanent long before the term in question,\n",
      "the two families had consented to the young people's wishes,\n",
      "and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,\n",
      "quite as soon as Louisa's.  \"And a very good living it was,\"\n",
      "Charles added:  \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,\n",
      "and in a very fine country:   fine part of Dorsetshire.\n",
      "In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,\n",
      "surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous\n",
      "than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get\n",
      "a special recommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,\"\n",
      "he observed, \"Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am extremely glad, indeed,\" cried Anne, \"particularly glad\n",
      "that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve\n",
      "equally well, and who have always been such good friends,\n",
      "the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--\n",
      "that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.\n",
      "I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer,\n",
      "but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming down with\n",
      "money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,\n",
      "and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do not mean to say\n",
      "they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should have\n",
      "daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,\n",
      "liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.\n",
      "She never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice,\n",
      "nor think enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to\n",
      "the value of the property.  It is a very fair match, as times go;\n",
      "and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne,\n",
      "\"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything\n",
      "to confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people\n",
      "to be in such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free\n",
      "from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\n",
      "and misery, both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa\n",
      "perfectly recovered now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;\n",
      "but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing\n",
      "or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to shut the door\n",
      "a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water;\n",
      "and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,\n",
      "all day long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could not help laughing.  \"That cannot be much to your taste,\n",
      "I know,\" said she; \"but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think\n",
      "I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\n",
      "pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can\n",
      "but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has done him\n",
      "no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.\n",
      "I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.\n",
      "We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in\n",
      "my father's great barns; and he played his part so well\n",
      "that I have liked him the better ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's\n",
      "following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had\n",
      "heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,\n",
      "and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,\n",
      "her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly\n",
      "have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want\n",
      "to lessen theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was\n",
      "in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,\n",
      "and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage\n",
      "with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,\n",
      "that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,\n",
      "and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,\n",
      "as they were detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister,\n",
      "and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\n",
      "drawing-rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.\n",
      "She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\n",
      "to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style,\n",
      "the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those\n",
      "who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.\n",
      "It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,\n",
      "and then Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions:\n",
      "\"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess\n",
      "to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;\n",
      "did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:\n",
      "and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;\n",
      "put her quite out of her way.  I am sure she would rather not come;\n",
      "she cannot feel easy with us.  I will ask them all for an evening;\n",
      "that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.\n",
      "They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted\n",
      "to come to-morrow evening.  It shall be a regular party, small,\n",
      "but most elegant.\"  And this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation\n",
      "was given to the two present, and promised for the absent,\n",
      "Mary was as completely satisfied.  She was particularly asked\n",
      "to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,\n",
      "who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not\n",
      "have received a more gratifying attention.  Miss Elliot was to have\n",
      "the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;\n",
      "and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her\n",
      "and Henrietta directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.\n",
      "They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;\n",
      "but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication\n",
      "could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,\n",
      "to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,\n",
      "with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,\n",
      "and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly\n",
      "in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,\n",
      "which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\n",
      "ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won\n",
      "by her usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness,\n",
      "and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,\n",
      "from the sad want of such blessings at home.  She was entreated\n",
      "to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day\n",
      "and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,\n",
      "she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,\n",
      "and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's\n",
      "history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions\n",
      "on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help\n",
      "which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;\n",
      "from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying\n",
      "to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,\n",
      "well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window\n",
      "overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have\n",
      "her moments of imagining.\n",
      "\n",
      "A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party\n",
      "in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes\n",
      "brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there\n",
      "half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,\n",
      "seemed more than half filled:  a party of steady old friends\n",
      "were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with\n",
      "Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The appearance of the latter\n",
      "could not be more than the surprise of the moment.  It was impossible\n",
      "for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\n",
      "common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\n",
      "Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;\n",
      "she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared\n",
      "from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had\n",
      "hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.\n",
      "He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,\n",
      "and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--\n",
      "\"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts\n",
      "must understand each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl,\n",
      "to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence,\n",
      "and wantonly playing with our own happiness.\"  And yet,\n",
      "a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company\n",
      "with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be\n",
      "exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\n",
      "mischievous kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne,\" cried Mary, still at her window, \"there is Mrs Clay,\n",
      "I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.\n",
      "I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed\n",
      "deep in talk.  Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.\n",
      "It is Mr Elliot himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.\n",
      "He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back\n",
      "till to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,\n",
      "the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret\n",
      "that she had said so much, simple as it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,\n",
      "began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting\n",
      "still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne\n",
      "to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,\n",
      "and tried to be cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned,\n",
      "however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\n",
      "two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves\n",
      "quite in the secret.  It was evident that the report concerning her\n",
      "had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure\n",
      "that it would now spread farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do come, Anne\" cried Mary, \"come and look yourself.  You will be too late\n",
      "if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking hands.\n",
      "He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to have\n",
      "forgot all about Lyme.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,\n",
      "Anne did move quietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain\n",
      "that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,\n",
      "before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off\n",
      "on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\n",
      "at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\n",
      "of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot,\n",
      "certainly.  He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all,\n",
      "or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;\" and walked back to her chair,\n",
      "recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off,\n",
      "and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.\n",
      "I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.\n",
      "A'n't I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.\n",
      "It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will\n",
      "not be sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.\n",
      "Have not I done well, mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\n",
      "for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary\n",
      "eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?\n",
      "Take a box for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged\n",
      "to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked\n",
      "to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all\n",
      "the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?\n",
      "How can you be so forgetful?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phoo! phoo!\" replied Charles, \"what's an evening party?\n",
      "Never worth remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner,\n",
      "I think, if he had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like,\n",
      "but I shall go to the play.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,\n",
      "when you promised to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word\n",
      "`happy.'  There was no promise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.\n",
      "We were asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always\n",
      "such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.\n",
      "Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.\n",
      "We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,\n",
      "whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  Every attention\n",
      "is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider, my father's heir:  the future\n",
      "representative of the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,\" cried Charles.\n",
      "\"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\n",
      "to the rising sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father,\n",
      "I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.\n",
      "What is Mr Elliot to me?\"  The careless expression was life to Anne,\n",
      "who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and\n",
      "listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought\n",
      "his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious\n",
      "and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,\n",
      "invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting\n",
      "to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,\n",
      "she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play\n",
      "without her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back\n",
      "and change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided,\n",
      "and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;\n",
      "and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,\n",
      "if Miss Anne could not be with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much\n",
      "so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home\n",
      "(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.\n",
      "I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy\n",
      "to change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better\n",
      "not be attempted, perhaps.\"  She had spoken it; but she trembled\n",
      "when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,\n",
      "and daring not even to try to observe their effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;\n",
      "Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,\n",
      "by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;\n",
      "probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,\n",
      "and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have not been long enough in Bath,\" said he, \"to enjoy\n",
      "the evening parties of the place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.\n",
      "I am no card-player.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards;\n",
      "but time makes many changes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not yet so much changed,\" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she\n",
      "hardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments\n",
      "he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,\n",
      "\"It is a period, indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination\n",
      "to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds\n",
      "he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,\n",
      "eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,\n",
      "and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else\n",
      "should come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready,\n",
      "and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known\n",
      "the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,\n",
      "in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own\n",
      "sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,\n",
      "wherewith to pity her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds\n",
      "were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open\n",
      "for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give\n",
      "a general chill.  Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked\n",
      "saw symptoms of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety\n",
      "of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,\n",
      "or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.\n",
      "How mortifying to feel that it was so!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth\n",
      "was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.\n",
      "She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.\n",
      "Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel\n",
      "explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying\n",
      "the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which\n",
      "was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.\n",
      "\"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:  no formal party.\"\n",
      "It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had\n",
      "provided herself, the \"Miss Elliot at home,\" were laid on the table,\n",
      "with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and\n",
      "one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The truth was,\n",
      "that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand\n",
      "the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.\n",
      "The past was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth\n",
      "would move about well in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given,\n",
      "and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation\n",
      "returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,\n",
      "but not to Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had\n",
      "with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which\n",
      "it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather\n",
      "than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.\n",
      "She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe\n",
      "that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement\n",
      "for all the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card\n",
      "in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!\" whispered Mary\n",
      "very audibly.  \"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!\n",
      "You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself\n",
      "into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,\n",
      "that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits,\n",
      "the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while\n",
      "Anne belonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine,\n",
      "and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been\n",
      "so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,\n",
      "and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent\n",
      "as she chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,\n",
      "she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place,\n",
      "there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\n",
      "of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration\n",
      "of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all\n",
      "the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\n",
      "of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending\n",
      "question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?  They were\n",
      "reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\n",
      "never appeased for five minutes together.  She generally thought\n",
      "he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case\n",
      "which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,\n",
      "as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,\n",
      "to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot\n",
      "three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,\n",
      "for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\n",
      "from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her\n",
      "there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened.  It was transient:\n",
      "cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there\n",
      "the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,\n",
      "or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend\n",
      "(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\n",
      "on Sir Walter.  She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable\n",
      "imitation of nature: --\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise\n",
      "I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.\n",
      "He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been prevented\n",
      "setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;\n",
      "for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer\n",
      "for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.\n",
      "He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.\n",
      "He was full of `to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been\n",
      "full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension\n",
      "of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have\n",
      "gone so entirely out of my head.\"\n",

      "One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith;\n",
      "but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched\n",
      "by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,\n",
      "that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer\n",
      "her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be\n",
      "with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted,\n",
      "and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head,\n",
      "must live another day.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not keep her appointment punctually, however;\n",
      "the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain\n",
      "on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own,\n",
      "before she was able to attempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart,\n",
      "and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself\n",
      "neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.\n",
      "The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,\n",
      "and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard\n",
      "that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment\n",
      "it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest\n",
      "injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there\n",
      "till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,\n",
      "be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once\n",
      "in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\n",
      "tasting a little before the morning closed.  There was no delay,\n",
      "no waste of time.  She was deep in the happiness of such misery,\n",
      "or the misery of such happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after\n",

      "\n",

      "and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest\n",
      "daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\n",
      "which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.\n",
      "Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,\n",
      "as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,\n",
      "she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,\n",
      "\"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again\n",
      "to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,\n",
      "and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred\n",
      "to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what\n",
      "I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded\n",
      "to think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style\n",
      "of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every advantage\n",
      "of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,\n",
      "could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft\n",
      "was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,\n",
      "it was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\n",
      "too much self-occupied to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove,\n",
      "in her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different,\n",
      "yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,\n",
      "for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was\n",
      "pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her\n",
      "finish her speech, \"there is nothing I so abominate for young people\n",
      "as a long engagement.  It is what I always protested against\n",
      "for my children.  It is all very well, I used to say, for young people\n",
      "to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\n",
      "in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, dear ma'am,\" said Mrs Croft, \"or an uncertain engagement,\n",

      "Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,\n",

      "easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\n",
      "than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself\n",
      "and went to him.  The window at which he stood was at the other end\n",
      "of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer\n",
      "to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near.  As she joined him,\n",
      "Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful\n",
      "expression which seemed its natural character.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying\n",
      "a small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly:  Captain Benwick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,\" (in a deep tone,)\n",
      "\"it was not done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our\n",
      "walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--\n",
      "but no matter.  This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with\n",
      "a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise\n",
      "to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;\n",
      "and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!\n",
      "It was a commission to me!  But who else was there to employ?\n",
      "I hope I can allow for him.  I am not sorry, indeed, to make it\n",
      "over to another.  He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)\n",
      "\"he is writing about it now.\"  And with a quivering lip he wound up\n",
      "the whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. \"That I can easily believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that\n",
      "for your sex?\" and she answered the question, smiling also,\n",
      "\"Yes.  We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.\n",
      "It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.\n",
      "We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.\n",
      "You are forced on exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits,\n",
      "business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,\n",
      "and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\n",
      "(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply\n",
      "to Benwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace\n",
      "turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us,\n",
      "in our little family circle, ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" said Anne, \"very true; I did not recollect; but what shall\n",
      "we say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from\n",
      "outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,\n",
      "man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more\n",
      "man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love,\n",
      "or have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy\n",
      "between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are\n",
      "the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,\n",
      "and riding out the heaviest weather.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit\n",
      "of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.\n",
      "Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;\n",
      "which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.\n",
      "Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.\n",
      "You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.\n",
      "You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.\n",
      "Your home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,\n",
      "nor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed\"\n",
      "(with a faltering voice), \"if woman's feelings were to be\n",
      "added to all this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville\n",
      "was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention\n",
      "to Captain Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.\n",
      "It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was\n",
      "startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined\n",
      "to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\n",
      "occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think\n",
      "he could have caught.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.\n",
      "I am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied,\n",
      "and want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,\"\n",
      "(lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree,\n",
      "I suppose, upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.\n",
      "But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,\n",
      "prose and verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you\n",
      "fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think\n",
      "I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\n",
      "upon woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk\n",
      "of woman's fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all\n",
      "written by men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples\n",
      "in books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.\n",
      "Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has\n",
      "been in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how shall we prove anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.\n",
      "It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.\n",
      "We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;\n",
      "and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\n",
      "which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances\n",
      "(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such\n",
      "as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,\n",
      "or in some respect saying what should not be said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,\n",
      "\"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\n",
      "a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat\n",
      "that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,\n",
      "and then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!'\n",
      "And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\n",
      "see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence,\n",
      "perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon\n",
      "it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,\n",
      "and saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while\n",
      "hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,\n",
      "as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!\n",
      "If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do,\n",
      "and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!\n",
      "I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!\" pressing his own\n",
      "with emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried Anne eagerly, \"I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you,\n",
      "and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should undervalue\n",
      "the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!\n",
      "I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment\n",
      "and constancy were known only by woman.  No, I believe you capable\n",
      "of everything great and good in your married lives.  I believe you equal\n",
      "to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,\n",
      "so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have\n",
      "an object.  I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.\n",
      "All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one;\n",
      "you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence\n",
      "or when hope is gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart\n",
      "was too full, her breath too much oppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand\n",
      "on her arm, quite affectionately.  \"There is no quarrelling with you.\n",
      "And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,\" said she.\n",
      "\"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.\n",
      "To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\"\n",
      "(turning to Anne.)  \"We had your sister's card yesterday,\n",
      "and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;\n",
      "and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either\n",
      "could not or would not answer fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but Harville and I\n",
      "shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,\n",
      "I am in half a minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.\n",
      "I shall be at your service in half a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter\n",
      "with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,\n",
      "agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how\n",
      "to understand it.  She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\"\n",
      "from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!\n",
      "He had passed out of the room without a look!\n",
      "\n",
      "She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where\n",
      "he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;\n",
      "the door opened, it was himself.  He begged their pardon,\n",
      "but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room\n",
      "to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper,\n",
      "placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\n",
      "for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room,\n",
      "almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:\n",
      "the work of an instant!\n",
      "\n",
      "The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost\n",
      "beyond expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible,\n",
      "to \"Miss A. E.--,\" was evidently the one which he had been folding\n",
      "so hastily.  While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,\n",
      "he had been also addressing her!  On the contents of that letter\n",
      "depended all which this world could do for her.  Anything was possible,\n",
      "anything might be defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had\n",
      "little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection\n",
      "she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,\n",
      "succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,\n",
      "her eyes devoured the following words:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means\n",
      "as are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony,\n",
      "half hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings\n",
      "are gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart\n",
      "even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years\n",
      "and a half ago.  Dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman,\n",
      "that his love has an earlier death.  I have loved none but you.\n",
      "Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,\n",
      "but never inconstant.  You alone have brought me to Bath.\n",
      "For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not seen this?\n",
      "Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not waited even\n",
      "these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have\n",
      "penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant hearing\n",
      "something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can\n",
      "distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.\n",
      "Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.\n",
      "You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.\n",
      "Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,\n",
      "or follow your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look,\n",
      "will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house\n",
      "this evening or never.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half and hour's solitude\n",
      "and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only\n",
      "which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints\n",
      "of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.  Every moment\n",
      "rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering happiness.\n",
      "And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,\n",
      "Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\n",
      "an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.\n",
      "She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged\n",
      "to plead indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see\n",
      "that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not\n",
      "stir without her for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only\n",
      "have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room\n",
      "it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or\n",
      "waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,\n",
      "she said she would go home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly,\n",
      "and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.\n",
      "I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.\n",
      "Charles, ring and order a chair.  She must not walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility\n",
      "of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,\n",
      "solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him)\n",
      "could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,\n",
      "and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,\n",
      "having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall\n",
      "in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,\n",
      "and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having\n",
      "had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on\n",
      "finding her better at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.\n",
      "Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\n",
      "to see your whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been\n",
      "some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville\n",
      "and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.\n",
      "Captain Harville has no thought but of going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.\n",
      "Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?\n",
      "You will see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain Harville\n",
      "anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed, my dear,\n",
      "you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,\n",
      "I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance\n",
      "to damp the perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting,\n",
      "however.  Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,\n",
      "it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\n",
      "by Captain Harville.  Another momentary vexation occurred.\n",
      "Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;\n",
      "there was no preventing him.  This was almost cruel.  But she could not\n",
      "be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's,\n",
      "to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling\n",
      "but gratitude apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something\n",
      "of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight\n",
      "of Captain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute\n",
      "whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.\n",
      "Anne could command herself enough to receive that look,\n",
      "and not repulsively.  The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,\n",
      "and the movements which had hesitated were decided.  He walked by her side.\n",
      "Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street,\n",
      "or farther up the town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?\n",
      "Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you\n",
      "to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.\n",
      "She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help,\n",
      "and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place.\n",
      "He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;\n",
      "said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,\n",
      "that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.\n",
      "By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine,\n",
      "which you shot with one day round Winthrop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most\n",
      "proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;\n",
      "and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.\n",
      "In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,\n",
      "and the other two proceeding together:  and soon words enough had passed\n",
      "between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\n",
      "and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make\n",
      "the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all\n",
      "the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\n",
      "could bestow.  There they exchanged again those feelings\n",
      "and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,\n",
      "but which had been followed by so many, many years of division\n",
      "and estrangement.  There they returned again into the past,\n",
      "more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when\n",
      "it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed\n",
      "in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment;\n",
      "more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as they slowly\n",
      "paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,\n",
      "seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,\n",
      "flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in\n",
      "those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in\n",
      "those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,\n",
      "which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little\n",
      "variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday\n",
      "and today there could scarcely be an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been\n",
      "the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate\n",
      "in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,\n",
      "after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him\n",
      "in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,\n",
      "in the last four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding\n",
      "to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions\n",
      "occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by\n",
      "those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\n",
      "with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which\n",
      "he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.\n",
      "He persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never been supplanted.\n",
      "He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thus much indeed\n",
      "he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constant unconsciously,\n",
      "nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it\n",
      "to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only\n",
      "been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been\n",
      "a sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on his mind\n",
      "as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\n",
      "and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross\n",
      "had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun\n",
      "to understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons\n",
      "of more than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot\n",
      "had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at\n",
      "Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove\n",
      "(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever\n",
      "felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,\n",
      "for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection\n",
      "which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence\n",
      "of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison,\n",
      "or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.\n",
      "There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\n",
      "and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness\n",
      "and the resolution of a collected mind.  There he had seen everything\n",
      "to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun\n",
      "to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,\n",
      "which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner\n",
      "been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\n",
      "of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,\n",
      "than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I found,\" said he, \"that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!\n",
      "That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our\n",
      "mutual attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree,\n",
      "I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect\n",
      "that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,\n",
      "perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour\n",
      "if she wished it.  I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously\n",
      "on this subject before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy\n",
      "must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had\n",
      "no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls,\n",
      "at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other\n",
      "ill effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;\n",
      "and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring\n",
      "for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,\n",
      "if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.\n",
      "It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.\n",
      "He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or\n",
      "speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,\n",
      "to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,\n",
      "and act as circumstances might require.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was six weeks with Edward,\" said he, \"and saw him happy.\n",
      "I could have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you\n",
      "very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,\n",
      "little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder\n",
      "for a reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured,\n",
      "in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm\n",
      "of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased\n",
      "to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be\n",
      "the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,\n",
      "and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa\n",
      "by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement\n",
      "with Benwick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least\n",
      "put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;\n",
      "I could do something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction,\n",
      "and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first\n",
      "five minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.\n",
      "Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive\n",
      "with some degree of hope?  You were single.  It was possible that\n",
      "you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement\n",
      "happened to be mine.  I could never doubt that you would be loved and\n",
      "sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man,\n",
      "at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help\n",
      "often saying, `Was this for me?'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,\n",
      "but the concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up\n",
      "of exquisite moments.  The moment of her stepping forward\n",
      "in the Octagon Room to speak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing\n",
      "and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,\n",
      "marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on\n",
      "with energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be\n",
      "my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,\n",
      "and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!\n",
      "To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope\n",
      "to influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent,\n",
      "to consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was it not enough\n",
      "to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look on\n",
      "without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you,\n",
      "was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,\n",
      "the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--\n",
      "was it not all against me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne.  \"You should not have\n",
      "suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.\n",
      "If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that\n",
      "it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.\n",
      "When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called\n",
      "in aid here.  In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk\n",
      "would have been incurred, and all duty violated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,\" he replied, \"but I could not.\n",
      "I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired\n",
      "of your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,\n",
      "buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under\n",
      "year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded,\n",
      "who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.\n",
      "I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.\n",
      "I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  The force of habit\n",
      "was to be added.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should have thought,\" said Anne, \"that my manner to yourself\n",
      "might have spared you much or all of this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement\n",
      "to another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet,\n",
      "I was determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning,\n",
      "and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house\n",
      "could have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other\n",
      "painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,\n",
      "she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy\n",
      "in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.\n",
      "An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective\n",
      "of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went\n",
      "to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness\n",
      "of her enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.\n",
      "It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had\n",
      "never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,\n",
      "too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found\n",
      "an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,\n",
      "and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,\n",
      "she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.\n",
      "Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.\n",
      "The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple\n",
      "and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.\n",
      "She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in\n",
      "the public manners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves,\n",
      "there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,\n",
      "the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,\n",
      "attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;\n",
      "with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and\n",
      "fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;\n",
      "and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications\n",
      "continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always\n",
      "the knowledge of his being there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied\n",
      "in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially\n",
      "to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;\n",
      "and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,\n",
      "that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom\n",
      "you will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place\n",
      "of a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying\n",
      "that she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases\n",
      "in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;\n",
      "and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance\n",
      "of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right\n",
      "in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have\n",
      "suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up,\n",
      "because I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now,\n",
      "as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing\n",
      "to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty\n",
      "is no bad part of a woman's portion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.\n",
      "I trust to being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been\n",
      "thinking over the past, and a  question has suggested itself,\n",
      "whether there may not have been one person more my enemy\n",
      "even than that lady?  My own self.  Tell me if, when I returned\n",
      "to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,\n",
      "and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,\n",
      "would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short,\n",
      "have renewed the engagement then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would I!\" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" he cried, \"you would!  It is not that I did not think of it,\n",
      "or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;\n",
      "but I was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.\n",
      "I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.\n",
      "This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one\n",
      "sooner than myself.  Six years of separation and suffering\n",
      "might have been spared.  It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.\n",
      "I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn\n",
      "every blessing that I enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils\n",
      "and just rewards.  Like other great men under reverses,\" he added,\n",

      "an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,\n",

      "fail of bearing down every opposition?  They might in fact,\n",

      "was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary,\n",
      "when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,\n",
      "and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,\n",
      "and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\n",
      "against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by\n",

      "and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,\n",
      "and do justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what\n",
      "Lady Russell had now to do.  She must learn to feel that she had\n",

      "had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them\n",

      "Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\n",
      "and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been\n",
      "too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\n",
      "opinions and well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less\n",
      "for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been\n",
      "pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions\n",

      "There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment\n",

      "in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted\n",
      "in this part of understanding than her young friend.  But she was\n",
      "a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible\n",
      "and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne\n",
      "better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness\n",
      "of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself\n",

      "perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored\n",
      "to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;\n",
      "but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.\n",
      "Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,\n",

      "and his own enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's\n",
      "quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established\n",
      "under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game\n",

      "to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter\n",

      "of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.\n",
      "There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion\n",
      "in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret;\n",

      "nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer\n",
      "in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her\n",
      "in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain\n",

      "acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties\n",
      "of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man\n",

      "fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have\n",
      "bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.\n",
      "She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,\n",

      "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.\n",
      "Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park,\n",
      "in the centre of their property, where, for many generations,\n",
      "they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage\n",
      "the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.\n",
      "The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived\n",
      "to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life,\n",
      "had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.\n",
      "But her death, which happened ten years before his own,\n",
      "produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply\n",
      "her loss, he invited and received into his house the family\n",
      "of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor\n",
      "of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended\n",
      "to bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece,\n",
      "and their children, the old Gentleman's days were\n",
      "comfortably spent.  His attachment to them all increased.\n",
      "The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood\n",
      "to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,\n",
      "but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n",
      "comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness\n",
      "of the children added a relish to his existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one\n",
      "son: by his present lady, three daughters.  The son,\n",
      "a steady respectable young man, was amply provided\n",
      "for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n",
      "and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.\n",
      "By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,\n",
      "he added to his wealth.  To him therefore the succession\n",
      "to the Norland estate was not so really important as to\n",
      "his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might\n",
      "arise to them from their father's inheriting that property,\n",
      "could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their\n",
      "father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;\n",
      "for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was\n",
      "also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest\n",
      "in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and\n",
      "like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment\n",
      "as pleasure.  He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful,\n",
      "as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him\n",
      "on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest.\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\n",
      "wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to\n",
      "his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old,\n",
      "it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself\n",
      "no power of providing for those who were most dear\n",
      "to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge\n",
      "on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.\n",
      "The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who,\n",
      "in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland,\n",
      "had so far gained on the affections of his uncle,\n",
      "by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\n",
      "of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,\n",
      "an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,\n",
      "and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value\n",
      "of all the attention which, for years, he had received\n",
      "from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to\n",
      "be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection\n",
      "for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe;\n",
      "but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might\n",
      "reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,\n",
      "lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate\n",
      "already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement.\n",
      "But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his\n",
      "only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer;\n",
      "and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies,\n",
      "was all that remained for his widow and daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known,\n",
      "and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength\n",
      "and urgency which illness could command, the interest\n",
      "of his mother-in-law and sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the\n",
      "rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation\n",
      "of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do\n",
      "every thing in his power to make them comfortable.\n",
      "His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\n",
      "and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how\n",
      "much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to\n",
      "be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be\n",
      "ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;\n",
      "for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge\n",
      "of his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman,\n",
      "he might have been made still more respectable than he\n",
      "was:--he might even have been made amiable himself; for he\n",
      "was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife.\n",
      "But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--\n",
      "more narrow-minded and selfish.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated\n",
      "within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters\n",
      "by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece.  He then\n",
      "really thought himself equal to it.  The prospect of four\n",
      "thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\n",
      "besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune,\n",
      "warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.--\n",
      "\"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would\n",
      "be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make\n",
      "them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he could\n",
      "spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"--\n",
      "He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively,\n",
      "and he did not repent.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her\n",
      "mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants.\n",
      "No one could dispute her right to come; the house was\n",
      "her husband's from the moment of his father's decease;\n",
      "but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater,\n",
      "and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only\n",
      "common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--\n",
      "but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,\n",
      "a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,\n",
      "by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source\n",
      "of immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never\n",
      "been a favourite with any of her husband's family;\n",
      "but she had had no opportunity, till the present,\n",
      "of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\n",
      "of other people she could act when occasion required it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious\n",
      "behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her\n",
      "daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,\n",
      "she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the\n",
      "entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect\n",
      "on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all\n",

      "Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was\n",
      "so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding,\n",
      "and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,\n",
      "though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother,\n",
      "and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage\n",
      "of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "which must generally have led to imprudence.  She had\n",
      "an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate,\n",
      "and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\n",
      "them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn;\n",
      "and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's abilities were, in many respects,\n",
      "quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever;\n",
      "but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have\n",
      "no moderation.  She was generous, amiable, interesting: she\n",
      "was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between\n",
      "her and her mother was strikingly great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her\n",
      "sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued\n",
      "and cherished.  They encouraged each other now in the\n",
      "violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief\n",
      "which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,\n",
      "was sought for, was created again and again.  They gave\n",
      "themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase\n",
      "of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it,\n",
      "and resolved against ever admitting consolation\n",
      "in future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still\n",
      "she could struggle, she could exert herself.  She could\n",
      "consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law\n",
      "on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\n",
      "and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion,\n",
      "and encourage her to similar forbearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored,\n",
      "well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed\n",

      "with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\n",
      "beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that\n",

      "they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not,\n",
      "they may all live very comfortably together on the interest\n",
      "of ten thousand pounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether,\n",
      "upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do\n",

      "and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.\n",
      "An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\n",
      "and over every year, and there is no getting rid\n",
      "of it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.\n",
      "I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities;\n",
      "for my mother was clogged with the payment of three\n",
      "to old superannuated servants by my father's will,\n",
      "and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it.\n",
      "Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then\n",
      "there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one\n",
      "of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned\n",
      "out to be no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.\n",
      "Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual\n",
      "claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father,\n",
      "because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at\n",
      "my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.\n",
      "It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am\n",
      "sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\n",
      "all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood,\n",

      "To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,\n",
      "on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away\n",
      "one's independence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.\n",
      "They think themselves secure, you do no more than what\n",
      "is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all.  If I were you,\n",
      "whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely.\n",
      "I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.\n",
      "It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred,\n",
      "or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better\n",
      "that there should by no annuity in the case; whatever I\n",
      "may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\n",
      "than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge\n",
      "their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income,\n",
      "and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\n",
      "of the year.  It will certainly be much the best way.\n",
      "A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent\n",
      "their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think,\n",
      "be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,\n",
      "I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\n",
      "of your giving them any money at all.  The assistance\n",
      "he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be\n",
      "reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking\n",
      "out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them\n",
      "to move their things, and sending them presents of fish\n",
      "and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season.\n",
      "I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\n",
      "it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.\n",
      "Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively\n",
      "comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live\n",
      "on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the\n",
      "thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings\n",
      "them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,\n",
      "they will pay their mother for their board out of it.\n",
      "Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,\n",
      "and what on earth can four women want for more than\n",
      "that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will\n",
      "be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,\n",
      "and hardly any servants; they will keep no company,\n",
      "and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive\n",
      "how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am\n",
      "sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it;\n",
      "and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think\n",
      "of it.  They will be much more able to give YOU something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you\n",
      "are perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean\n",
      "nothing more by his request to me than what you say.\n",
      "I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\n",
      "my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\n",
      "to them as you have described.  When my mother removes\n",
      "into another house my services shall be readily given\n",
      "to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present\n",
      "of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however,\n",
      "ONE thing must be considered.  When your father and mother\n",
      "moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill\n",
      "was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved,\n",
      "and is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore\n",
      "be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.\n",
      "A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would\n",
      "have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice\n",
      "as handsome as what belongs to this house.  A great\n",
      "deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY\n",
      "can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.\n",
      "Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this:\n",
      "that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention\n",
      "to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could,\n",
      "he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his\n",
      "intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he\n",
      "finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary,\n",
      "if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow\n",
      "and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly\n",
      "acts as his own wife pointed out.\n",

      "Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months;\n",
      "not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\n",
      "well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\n",
      "produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive,\n",
      "and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\n",
      "of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances,\n",
      "she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries\n",
      "for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland;\n",
      "for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.\n",
      "But she could hear of no situation that at once answered\n",
      "her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence\n",
      "of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected\n",
      "several houses as too large for their income, which her\n",
      "mother would have approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\n",
      "solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour,\n",
      "which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections.\n",
      "She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\n",
      "had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters'\n",
      "sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\n",
      "persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would\n",
      "support her in affluence.  For their brother's sake, too,\n",
      "for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she\n",
      "reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before,\n",
      "in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive\n",
      "behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\n",
      "their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time,\n",
      "she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance,\n",
      "felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased\n",
      "by the farther knowledge of her character, which half\n",
      "a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps\n",
      "in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\n",
      "affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might\n",
      "have found it impossible to have lived together so long,\n",
      "had not a particular circumstance occurred to give\n",
      "still greater eligibility, according to the opinions\n",
      "of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.\n",
      "\n",
      "This circumstance was a growing attachment between\n",
      "her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced\n",
      "to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment\n",
      "at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part\n",
      "of his time there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\n",
      "motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son\n",
      "of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed\n",
      "it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum,\n",
      "the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother.\n",
      "But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration.\n",
      "It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\n",
      "that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned\n",
      "the partiality.  It was contrary to every doctrine of\n",
      "her's that difference of fortune should keep any couple\n",
      "asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition;\n",
      "and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged\n",
      "by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good\n",
      "opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address.\n",
      "He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy\n",
      "to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice\n",
      "to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\n",
      "his behaviour gave every indication of an open,\n",
      "affectionate heart.  His understanding was good,\n",
      "and his education had given it solid improvement.\n",
      "But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\n",
      "to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed\n",
      "to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.\n",
      "They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\n",
      "manner or other.  His mother wished to interest him in\n",
      "political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see\n",
      "him connected with some of the great men of the day.\n",
      "Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while,\n",
      "till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would\n",
      "have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche.\n",
      "But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches.\n",
      "All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\n",
      "of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother\n",
      "who was more promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward had been staying several weeks in the house\n",
      "before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention;\n",
      "for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered\n",
      "her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw only that he\n",
      "was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.\n",
      "He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\n",
      "ill-timed conversation.  She was first called to observe\n",
      "and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor\n",
      "chanced one day to make on the difference between him\n",
      "and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him\n",
      "most forcibly to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is enough,\" said she; \"to say that he is unlike\n",
      "Fanny is enough.  It implies everything amiable.\n",
      "I love him already.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you\n",
      "know more of him.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.\n",
      "Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.\n",
      "She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion\n",
      "of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;\n",
      "but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that\n",
      "quietness of manner, which militated against all her\n",
      "established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,\n",
      "was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be\n",
      "warm and his temper affectionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love\n",
      "in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their\n",
      "serious attachment as certain, and looked forward\n",
      "to their marriage as rapidly approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a few months, my dear Marianne.\" said she,\n",

      "\"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.\n",
      "We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall\n",
      "meet every day of our lives.  You will gain a brother,\n",
      "a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion\n",
      "in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave,\n",
      "Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's choice?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Marianne, \"I may consider it\n",
      "with some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love\n",
      "him tenderly.  But yet--he is not the kind of young\n",
      "man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking;\n",
      "it has none of that grace which I should expect\n",
      "in the man who could seriously attach my sister.\n",
      "His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once\n",
      "announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides all this,\n",
      "I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems\n",
      "scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's\n",
      "drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person\n",
      "who can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of\n",
      "his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\n",
      "he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as a lover,\n",
      "not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters\n",
      "must be united.  I could not be happy with a man whose\n",
      "taste did not in every point coincide with my own.\n",
      "He must enter into all my feelings; the same books,\n",
      "the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how spiritless,\n",
      "how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!\n",
      "I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it\n",
      "with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.\n",
      "I could hardly keep my seat.  To hear those beautiful lines\n",
      "which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced\n",
      "with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He would certainly have done more justice to\n",
      "simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time;\n",
      "but you WOULD give him Cowper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Mamma, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--\n",
      "but we must allow for difference of taste.  Elinor has\n",
      "not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and\n",
      "be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,\n",
      "had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\n",
      "Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced\n",
      "that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.\n",
      "I require so much!  He must have all Edward's virtues,\n",

      "\"that Edward should have no taste for drawing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No taste for drawing!\" replied Elinor, \"why should\n",
      "you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has\n",
      "great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people,\n",
      "and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste,\n",
      "though he has not had opportunities of improving it.\n",
      "Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would\n",
      "have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment\n",
      "in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling\n",
      "to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate\n",
      "propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general\n",
      "direct him perfectly right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more\n",
      "on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor\n",
      "described as excited in him by the drawings of other\n",
      "people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which,\n",
      "in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though\n",
      "smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured\n",
      "her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope, Marianne,\" continued Elinor, \"you do not\n",
      "consider him as deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think\n",
      "I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him\n",
      "is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,\n",
      "I am sure you could never be civil to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would\n",
      "not wound the feelings of her sister on any account,\n",
      "and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible.\n",
      "At length she replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him\n",
      "is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.\n",
      "I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\n",
      "propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes,\n",
      "as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world\n",
      "of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is\n",
      "worthy and amiable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" replied Elinor, with a smile,\n",
      "\"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\n",

      "Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of his sense and his goodness,\" continued Elinor,\n",
      "\"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him\n",
      "often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation.\n",
      "The excellence of his understanding and his principles\n",
      "can be concealed only by that shyness which too often\n",
      "keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice\n",
      "to his solid worth.  But of his minuter propensities,\n",
      "as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\n",
      "been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I have\n",
      "been at times thrown a good deal together, while you\n",
      "have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\n",
      "principle by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,\n",
      "have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\n",
      "subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole,\n",
      "I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed,\n",
      "enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively,\n",
      "his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate\n",
      "and pure.  His abilities in every respect improve\n",
      "as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.\n",
      "At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;\n",

      "expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good,\n",
      "and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived.\n",
      "At present, I know him so well, that I think him\n",

      "Marianne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I\n",
      "do not now.  When you tell me to love him as a brother,\n",
      "I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do\n",
      "in his heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for\n",
      "the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.\n",
      "She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion.\n",
      "She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required\n",
      "greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction\n",
      "of their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that\n",
      "what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment,\n",
      "they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I do not attempt to deny,\" said she, \"that I think\n",
      "very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.\"\n",

      "by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.\n",
      "Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;\n",
      "believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the\n",
      "suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant,\n",
      "without imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must\n",
      "not believe.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.\n",
      "There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful;\n",
      "and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder\n",
      "at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality,\n",
      "by believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart\n",
      "I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference.\n",
      "But there are other points to be considered besides\n",
      "his inclination.  He is very far from being independent.\n",
      "What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's\n",
      "occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have\n",
      "never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very\n",
      "much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there\n",
      "would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish\n",
      "to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\n",
      "high rank.\"\n",

      "\"And you really are not engaged to him!\" said she.\n",
      "\"Yet it certainly soon will happen.  But two advantages\n",
      "will proceed from this delay.  I shall not lose you so soon,\n",
      "and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving\n",
      "that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\n",
      "be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.\n",
      "Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to\n",
      "learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.\n",
      "She could not consider her partiality for Edward\n",
      "in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it.\n",
      "There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,\n",
      "if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost\n",
      "as unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him\n",
      "to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.\n",
      "It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind\n",
      "which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable cause\n",
      "might be found in the dependent situation which forbade\n",
      "the indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother\n",
      "neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable\n",
      "at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form\n",
      "a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views\n",
      "for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,\n",
      "it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.\n",
      "She was far from depending on that result of his preference\n",
      "of her, which her mother and sister still considered\n",
      "as certain.  Nay, the longer they were together the more\n",
      "doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes,\n",
      "for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\n",
      "than friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough,\n",
      "when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy,\n",
      "and at the same time, (which was still more common,)\n",
      "to make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of\n",
      "affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to\n",
      "her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,\n",
      "of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should\n",
      "marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman\n",
      "who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could\n",
      "neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm.\n",
      "She gave her an answer which marked her contempt,\n",
      "and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might\n",

      "on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own,\n",
      "a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.\n",
      "The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written\n",
      "in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.\n",
      "He understood that she was in need of a dwelling;\n",
      "and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\n",
      "he assured her that everything should be done to it which\n",
      "she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her.\n",
      "He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars\n",
      "of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to\n",
      "Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence\n",
      "she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the\n",
      "houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration,\n",
      "be made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to\n",
      "accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\n",
      "in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\n",
      "to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\n",
      "suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\n",
      "nearer connections.  She needed no time for deliberation\n",
      "or inquiry.  Her resolution was formed as she read.\n",
      "The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from\n",
      "Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before,\n",
      "would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\n",
      "possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its\n",
      "first recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland\n",
      "was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire;\n",
      "it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing\n",
      "her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever\n",
      "from that beloved place would be less painful than to\n",
      "inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.\n",
      "She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment\n",
      "of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal;\n",

      "The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so\n",
      "simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,\n",
      "as to leave her no right of objection on either point;\n",
      "and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought\n",
      "any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from\n",

      "how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\n",
      "such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any\n",
      "service to her in removing her furniture.  He really felt\n",
      "conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion\n",
      "to which he had limited the performance of his promise to\n",
      "his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.--\n",
      "The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly\n",
      "consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,\n",

      "their interest in the appearance of a country which they\n",

      "Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.\n",
      "It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich\n",
      "in pasture.  After winding along it for more than a mile,\n",
      "they reached their own house.  A small green court was\n",

      "building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window\n",
      "shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered\n",
      "with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through\n",
      "the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the\n",
      "entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;\n",

      "Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.\n",

      "for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\n",
      "It was very early in September; the season was fine,\n",

      "favour which was of material service in recommending\n",
      "it to their lasting approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose\n",
      "immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;\n",
      "some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.\n",
      "The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills,\n",
      "and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.\n",
      "The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the\n",
      "whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.\n",
      "The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated\n",

      "indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her;\n",
      "and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all\n",
      "that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.\n",
      "\"As for the house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is\n",
      "too small for our family, but we will make ourselves\n",
      "tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late\n",
      "in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring,\n",
      "if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may\n",
      "think about building.  These parlors are both too small\n",
      "for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often\n",
      "collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the\n",
      "passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other,\n",
      "and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance;\n",
      "this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added,\n",
      "and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug\n",

      "as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival\n",
      "seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort\n",
      "to be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much\n",
      "of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\n",
      "terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially\n",

      "settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried\n",
      "to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could\n",

      "for within an hour after he left them, a large basket\n",
      "full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park,\n",
      "which was followed before the end of the day by a present\n",
      "of game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their\n",

      "she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience;\n",
      "and as this message was answered by an invitation\n",
      "equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on\n",

      "Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;\n",
      "her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\n",

      "their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly\n",
      "well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say\n",
      "for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John\n",
      "was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise\n",
      "precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine\n",
      "little boy about six years old, by which means there was\n",
      "one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case\n",
      "of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age,\n",

      "answered for him, while he hung about her and held\n",
      "down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship,\n",
      "who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he\n",
      "could make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit\n",
      "a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision\n",
      "for discourse.  In the present case it took up ten minutes\n",
      "to determine whether the boy were most like his father\n",
      "or mother, and in what particular he resembled either,\n",

      "projection of a hill.  The house was large and handsome;\n",
      "and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\n",
      "and elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification,\n",
      "the latter for that of his lady.  They were scarcely\n",
      "ever without some friends staying with them in the house,\n",

      "he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\n",
      "of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE\n",
      "in the country? That is good news however; I will\n",
      "ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here\n",
      "every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.\n",
      "A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider\n",
      "in England.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne,\n",
      "indignantly.  \"But what are his manners on more intimate\n",
      "acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John was rather puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him\n",
      "as to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow,\n",
      "and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\n",
      "I ever saw.  Was she out with him today?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\n",
      "colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could\n",
      "describe to her the shades of his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come\n",
      "from?  Has he a house at Allenham?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;\n",
      "and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property\n",
      "of his own in the country; that he resided there only\n",
      "while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,\n",
      "to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\n",
      "to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth\n",
      "catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty\n",
      "little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides;\n",
      "and if I were you, I would not give him up to my\n",
      "younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.\n",
      "Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.\n",
      "Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a\n",
      "good humoured smile, \"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded\n",
      "by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what\n",
      "you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which\n",
      "they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us,\n",
      "let them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however,\n",
      "from what you say, that he is a respectable young man,\n",
      "and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe,\n",
      "as ever lived,\" repeated Sir John.  \"I remember\n",
      "last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced\n",
      "from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes,\n",
      "\"and with elegance, with spirit?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought\n",
      "to be.  Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them\n",
      "should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see\n",
      "how it will be.  You will be setting your cap at him now,\n",
      "and never think of poor Brandon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "warmly, \"which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every\n",
      "common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting\n",
      "one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most\n",
      "odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;\n",
      "and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,\n",
      "time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John did not much understand this reproof;\n",
      "but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say,\n",
      "one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already,\n",
      "and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can\n",
      "tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\n",
      "of ankles.\"\n",

      "Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance\n",
      "than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage\n",
      "early the next morning to make his personal enquiries.\n",
      "He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness;\n",
      "with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own\n",
      "gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during\n",
      "the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance,\n",
      "mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family\n",
      "to whom accident had now introduced him.  Of their\n",
      "personal charms he had not required a second interview\n",
      "to be convinced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,\n",
      "regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.\n",
      "Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so\n",
      "correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height,\n",
      "was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when\n",
      "in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,\n",
      "truth was less violently outraged than usually happens.\n",
      "Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency,\n",
      "her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features\n",
      "were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;\n",
      "and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,\n",
      "a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen\n",
      "without delight.  From Willoughby their expression was at\n",
      "first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance\n",
      "of his assistance created.  But when this passed away,\n",
      "when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the\n",
      "perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness\n",
      "and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare,\n",
      "that of music and dancing he was passionately fond,\n",
      "she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\n",
      "largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\n",
      "of his stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only necessary to mention any favourite\n",
      "amusement to engage her to talk.  She could not be\n",
      "silent when such points were introduced, and she\n",
      "had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.\n",
      "They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\n",
      "and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general\n",
      "conformity of judgment in all that related to either.\n",
      "Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\n",
      "she proceeded to question him on the subject of books;\n",
      "her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\n",
      "upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of\n",
      "five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to\n",
      "become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works,\n",
      "however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly alike.\n",
      "The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--\n",
      "or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,\n",
      "it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\n",
      "and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed.\n",
      "He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;\n",
      "and long before his visit concluded, they conversed\n",
      "with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them,\n",
      "\"for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.\n",
      "You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in\n",
      "almost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks\n",
      "of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating\n",
      "their beauties as he ought, and you have received every\n",
      "assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\n",
      "But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\n",
      "extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?\n",
      "You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.\n",
      "Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\n",
      "on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then\n",
      "you can have nothing farther to ask.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this\n",
      "just? are my ideas so scanty?  But I see what you mean.\n",
      "I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank.\n",
      "I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum;\n",
      "I have been open and sincere where I ought to have\n",
      "been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had\n",
      "I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I\n",
      "spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have\n",
      "been spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended\n",
      "with Elinor--she was only in jest.  I should scold\n",
      "her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check\n",
      "the delight of your conversation with our new friend.\"--\n",
      "Marianne was softened in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his\n",
      "pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish\n",
      "of improving it could offer.  He came to them every day.\n",
      "To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the\n",
      "encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\n",
      "greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it\n",
      "had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.\n",
      "She was confined for some days to the house; but never had\n",
      "any confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young\n",
      "man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits,\n",
      "and open, affectionate manners.  He was exactly formed\n",
      "to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined\n",
      "not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour\n",
      "of mind which was now roused and increased by the example\n",
      "of her own, and which recommended him to her affection\n",
      "beyond every thing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.\n",
      "They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical\n",
      "talents were considerable; and he read with all the\n",
      "sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless\n",
      "as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him\n",
      "but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\n",
      "delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on\n",
      "every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.\n",
      "In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people,\n",
      "in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\n",
      "of undivided attention where his heart was engaged,\n",
      "and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety,\n",
      "he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve,\n",
      "in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation\n",
      "which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever\n",
      "seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection,\n",
      "had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all\n",
      "that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\n",
      "and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her;\n",
      "and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\n",
      "as earnest, as his abilities were strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative\n",
      "thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect\n",
      "of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and\n",
      "expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having\n",
      "gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had\n",
      "so early been discovered by his friends, now first became\n",
      "perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed\n",
      "by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn off to his\n",
      "more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other\n",
      "had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed\n",
      "when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\n",
      "so justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,\n",
      "though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction,\n",
      "were now actually excited by her sister; and that however\n",
      "a general resemblance of disposition between the parties\n",
      "might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally\n",
      "striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\n",
      "regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;\n",
      "for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,\n",
      "when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as\n",
      "she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished\n",
      "him indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity\n",
      "and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\n",
      "His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve\n",
      "appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\n",
      "than of any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John\n",
      "had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments,\n",
      "which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man,\n",
      "and she regarded him with respect and compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\n",
      "because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,\n",
      "who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively\n",
      "nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby\n",
      "one day, when they were talking of him together,\n",
      "\"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;\n",
      "whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\n",
      "to talk to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it\n",
      "is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed\n",
      "by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself\n",
      "without taking pains to converse with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby,\n",
      "\"is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem\n",
      "of the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Who would\n",
      "submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\n",
      "as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command\n",
      "the indifference of any body else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\n",
      "and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady\n",
      "Middleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,\n",
      "your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning,\n",
      "than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man;\n",
      "and sense will always have attractions for me.\n",
      "Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.\n",
      "He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,\n",
      "has read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him\n",
      "capable of giving me much information on various subjects;\n",
      "and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\n",
      "good-breeding and good nature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously,\n",
      "\"he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot,\n",
      "and the mosquitoes are troublesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made\n",
      "any such inquiries, but they happened to be points\n",
      "on which I had been previously informed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may\n",
      "have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs,\n",
      "and palanquins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may venture to say that HIS observations\n",
      "have stretched much further than your candour.\n",
      "But why should you dislike him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary,\n",
      "as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word,\n",
      "and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend,\n",
      "more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats\n",
      "every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has\n",
      "neither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding\n",
      "has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice\n",
      "no expression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\"\n",
      "replied Elinor, \"and so much on the strength of your\n",
      "own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give\n",
      "of him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only\n",
      "pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed,\n",
      "of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using\n",
      "me unkindly.  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason,\n",
      "and to convince me against my will.  But it will not do.\n",
      "You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful.  I have\n",
      "three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;\n",
      "he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine;\n",
      "he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,\n",
      "and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it\n",
      "will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told,\n",
      "that I believe his character to be in other respects\n",
      "irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return\n",
      "for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain,\n",
      "you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\n",

      "concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;\n",
      "and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\n",
      "in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely\n",

      "\n",
      "This was the season of happiness to Marianne.\n",
      "Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment\n",
      "to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex,\n",
      "was more likely to be softened than she had thought it\n",
      "possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed\n",
      "on her present home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not\n",
      "so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements\n",
      "so pure.  They afforded her no companion that could make\n",
      "amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach\n",
      "her to think of Norland with less regret than ever.\n",
      "Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply\n",
      "to her the conversation she missed; although the latter\n",
      "was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded\n",
      "her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\n",
      "her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history\n",
      "to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been\n",
      "equal to her means of improvement, she might have known\n",
      "very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\n",
      "Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what he said to his wife\n",
      "a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton was more\n",
      "agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.\n",
      "Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her\n",
      "reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\n",
      "had nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she\n",
      "was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore\n",
      "neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing\n",
      "to say one day that she had not said the day before.\n",
      "Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were\n",
      "always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\n",
      "arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted\n",
      "in style and her two eldest children attended her,\n",
      "she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them\n",
      "than she might have experienced in sitting at home;--\n",
      "and so little did her presence add to the pleasure\n",
      "of the others, by any share in their conversation,\n",
      "that they were sometimes only reminded of her being\n",
      "amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance,\n",
      "did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the\n",
      "respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,\n",
      "or give pleasure as a companion.  Willoughby was out\n",
      "of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even her\n",
      "sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover;\n",
      "his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less\n",
      "agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing.\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such\n",
      "encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing\n",
      "with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\n",
      "indifference of her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason\n",
      "to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\n",
      "been known to him.  This suspicion was given by some words\n",
      "which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,\n",
      "when they were sitting down together by mutual consent,\n",
      "while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed\n",
      "on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes,\n",
      "he said, with a faint smile, \"Your sister, I understand,\n",
      "does not approve of second attachments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them\n",
      "impossible to exist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it\n",
      "without reflecting on the character of her own father,\n",
      "who had himself two wives, I know not.  A few years\n",
      "however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\n",
      "of common sense and observation; and then they may be\n",
      "more easy to define and to justify than they now are,\n",
      "by any body but herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied;\n",
      "\"and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices\n",
      "of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way\n",
      "to the reception of more general opinions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\"There are inconveniences attending such feelings\n",
      "as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and\n",
      "ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems have\n",
      "all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought;\n",
      "and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look\n",
      "forward to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause he resumed the conversation\n",
      "by saying,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections\n",
      "against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal\n",
      "in every body?  Are those who have been disappointed\n",
      "in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy\n",
      "of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances,\n",
      "to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae\n",
      "of her principles.  I only know that I never yet heard her\n",
      "admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change,\n",
      "a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not desire it;\n",
      "for when the romantic refinements of a young mind\n",
      "are obliged to give way, how frequently are they\n",
      "succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too\n",
      "dangerous!  I speak from experience.  I once knew a lady\n",
      "who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister,\n",
      "who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced\n",
      "change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--\n",
      "Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said\n",
      "too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures,\n",
      "which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head.\n",
      "The lady would probably have passed without suspicion,\n",
      "had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned\n",
      "her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was,\n",
      "it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\n",
      "emotion with the tender recollection of past regard.\n",
      "Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, in her place,\n",
      "would not have done so little.  The whole story would\n",
      "have been speedily formed under her active imagination;\n",
      "and every thing established in the most melancholy order\n",
      "of disastrous love.\n",

      "As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the\n",

      "to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew\n",
      "before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,\n",
      "surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.\n",
      "Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that\n",
      "Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred\n",
      "himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\n",
      "exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering\n",
      "that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse,\n",
      "that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of\n",
      "this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and\n",
      "keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\n",
      "to receive them, she had accepted the present without\n",
      "hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire\n",
      "immediately for it,\" she added, \"and when it arrives we\n",
      "will ride every day.  You shall share its use with me.\n",
      "Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop\n",
      "on some of these downs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of\n",
      "felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended\n",
      "the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.\n",
      "As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle;\n",
      "Mamma she was sure would never object to it; and any horse\n",
      "would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park;\n",
      "as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.\n",
      "Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving\n",
      "such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately\n",
      "known to her.  This was too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly,\n",
      "\"in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.\n",
      "I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better\n",
      "acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature\n",
      "in the world, except yourself and mama.  It is not\n",
      "time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;--\n",
      "it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficient\n",
      "to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\n",
      "days are more than enough for others.  I should hold\n",
      "myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse\n",
      "from my brother, than from Willoughby.  Of John I know\n",
      "very little, though we have lived together for years;\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.\n",
      "She knew her sister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a\n",
      "subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion.\n",
      "But by an appeal to her affection for her mother,\n",
      "by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\n",
      "mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be\n",
      "the case) she consented to this increase of establishment,\n",
      "Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to\n",
      "tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning\n",
      "the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,\n",
      "that it must be declined.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby\n",
      "called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her\n",

      "being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present.\n",
      "The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\n",
      "and they were such as to make further entreaty on his\n",
      "side impossible.  His concern however was very apparent;\n",
      "and after expressing it with earnestness, he added,\n",
      "in the same low voice,--\"But, Marianne, the horse is\n",
      "still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I shall keep\n",
      "it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton\n",
      "to form your own establishment in a more lasting home,\n",
      "Queen Mab shall receive you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the\n",
      "whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,\n",
      "and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone,\n",
      "she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning\n",
      "so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them.\n",
      "From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged\n",
      "to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise\n",
      "than that she, or any of their friends, should be left\n",
      "by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret related something to her the next day,\n",
      "which placed this matter in a still clearer light.\n",
      "Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them,\n",
      "and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\n",
      "with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity\n",
      "for observations, which, with a most important face,\n",
      "she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were\n",
      "next by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to\n",

      "to Mr. Willoughby very soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every\n",
      "day since they first met on High-church Down; and they\n",
      "had not known each other a week, I believe, before you\n",
      "were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck;\n",
      "but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure\n",
      "they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock\n",
      "of her hair.\"\n",

      "\"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair\n",
      "of some great uncle of HIS.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost\n",
      "sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  Last night\n",
      "after tea, when you and mama went out of the room,\n",
      "they were whispering and talking together as fast as\n",
      "could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her,\n",
      "and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\n",
      "lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;\n",
      "and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;\n",
      "and put it into his pocket-book.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For such particulars, stated on such authority,\n",
      "Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed\n",

      "what she had heard and seen herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a\n",
      "way so satisfactory to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name\n",
      "of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite,\n",
      "which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\n",
      "Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying,\n",
      "\"I must not tell, may I, Elinor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor\n",
      "tried to laugh too.  But the effort was painful.\n",
      "She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person\n",
      "whose name she could not bear with composure to become\n",
      "a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did\n",
      "more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red\n",
      "and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be,\n",
      "you have no right to repeat them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never had any conjectures about it,\" replied Margaret;\n",
      "\"it was you who told me of it yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret\n",
      "was eagerly pressed to say something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Jennings.  \"What is the gentleman's name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is;\n",
      "and I know where he is too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house\n",
      "at Norland to be sure.  He is the curate of the parish\n",
      "I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Margaret,\" said Marianne with great warmth,\n",

      "and that there is no such person in existence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I\n",

      "with an F.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton\n",
      "for observing, at this moment, \"that it rained very hard,\"\n",
      "though she believed the interruption to proceed less from\n",
      "any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike\n",
      "of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\n",
      "her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her,\n",
      "was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was\n",
      "on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others;\n",
      "and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them.\n",
      "Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne\n",
      "to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours\n",
      "of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.\n",
      "But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into\n",
      "which it had thrown her.\n",

      "who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head.\n",
      "The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful,\n",
      "and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,\n",
      "might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had\n",
      "formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer\n",
      "for the last ten years.  They contained a noble piece\n",
      "of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of\n",
      "the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken,\n",
      "open carriages only to be employed, and every thing\n",
      "conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.\n",

      "a bold undertaking, considering the time of year,\n",

      "\n",
      "The complaints and lamentations which politeness\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I can guess what his business is, however,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Jennings exultingly.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am\n",
      "sure you must have heard of her before.  She is a relation\n",
      "of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation.  We will\n",
      "not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies.\"\n",
      "Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\n",
      "\"She is his natural daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily\n",
      "in the general regret on so unfortunate an event;\n",
      "concluding however by observing, that as they were\n",
      "all got together, they must do something by way of\n",
      "being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,\n",
      "that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell,\n",
      "they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\n",
      "about the country.  The carriages were then ordered;\n",
      "Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked\n",
      "happier than when she got into it.  He drove through\n",
      "the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight;\n",
      "and nothing more of them was seen till their return,\n",
      "which did not happen till after the return of all the rest.\n",
      "They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said\n",
      "only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes,\n",
      "while the others went on the downs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening,\n",
      "and that every body should be extremely merry all day long.\n",
      "Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the\n",
      "pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir\n",
      "John observed with great contentment.  Willoughby took\n",
      "his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not\n",
      "been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby,\n",
      "and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,\n",
      "\"I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.\n",
      "I know where you spent the morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily,\n",
      "\"Where, pray?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had\n",
      "been out in my curricle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well,\n",
      "and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.--\n",
      "I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.  It is a very\n",
      "large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you\n",
      "will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much\n",
      "when I was there six years ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne turned away in great confusion.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her\n",
      "resolution to know where they had been, she had actually\n",
      "made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom;\n",
      "and that she had by that method been informed that they\n",
      "had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there\n",
      "in walking about the garden and going all over the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could hardly believe this to be true,\n",
      "as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose,\n",
      "or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was\n",
      "in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired\n",
      "of her about it; and great was her surprise when she\n",
      "found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry with her\n",
      "for doubting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not\n",
      "go there, or that we did not see the house?  Is not it\n",
      "what you have often wished to do yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith\n",
      "was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can\n",
      "have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open\n",
      "carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion.\n",
      "I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness\n",
      "of an employment does not always evince its propriety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof\n",
      "of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety\n",
      "in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at\n",
      "the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong,\n",
      "and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you\n",
      "to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin\n",
      "to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are\n",
      "to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all\n",
      "offending every moment of our lives.  I value not her\n",
      "censure any more than I should do her commendation.\n",
      "I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\n",
      "over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.\n",
      "They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne,\n",
      "you would not be justified in what you have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly\n",
      "gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of\n",
      "earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said\n",
      "with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather\n",
      "ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted\n",
      "particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house,\n",
      "I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room\n",
      "up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use,\n",
      "and with modern furniture it would be delightful.\n",
      "It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.\n",
      "On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind\n",
      "the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you\n",
      "have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them,\n",
      "of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.\n",
      "I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be\n",
      "more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly\n",
      "fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,\n",
      "would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms\n",
      "in England.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption\n",
      "from the others, she would have described every room\n",
      "in the house with equal delight.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit\n",
      "at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause,\n",
      "filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every\n",
      "one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the\n",
      "comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered,\n",
      "with little intermission what could be the reason of it;\n",
      "was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over\n",
      "every kind of distress that could have befallen him,\n",
      "with a fixed determination that he should not escape\n",
      "them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something very melancholy must be the matter,\n",
      "I am sure,\" said she.  \"I could see it in his face.\n",
      "Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances may be bad.\n",
      "The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\n",
      "a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.\n",
      "I do think he must have been sent for about money matters,\n",
      "for what else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.\n",
      "I would give anything to know the truth of it.  Perhaps it\n",
      "is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,\n",
      "because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.\n",
      "May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely,\n",
      "for I have a notion she is always rather sickly.\n",
      "I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams.\n",
      "It is not so very likely he should be distressed in\n",
      "his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,\n",
      "and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time.\n",
      "I wonder what it can be!  May be his sister is worse\n",
      "at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting off\n",
      "in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out\n",
      "of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into\n",
      "the bargain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion\n",
      "varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming\n",
      "equally probable as they arose.  Elinor, though she felt\n",
      "really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\n",
      "away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;\n",
      "for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\n",
      "justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,\n",
      "her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was engrossed\n",
      "by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby\n",
      "on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly\n",
      "interesting to them all.  As this silence continued,\n",
      "every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\n",
      "with the disposition of both.  Why they should not openly\n",
      "acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\n",
      "behaviour to each other declared to have taken place,\n",
      "Elinor could not imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could easily conceive that marriage might not\n",
      "be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby\n",
      "was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich.\n",
      "His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven\n",
      "hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income\n",
      "could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained\n",
      "of his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy\n",
      "maintained by them relative to their engagement, which\n",
      "in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account;\n",
      "and it was so wholly contradictory to their general\n",
      "opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered\n",
      "her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt\n",
      "was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more expressive of attachment\n",
      "to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne\n",
      "it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's\n",
      "heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the\n",
      "affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The cottage\n",
      "seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;\n",
      "many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham;\n",
      "and if no general engagement collected them at the park,\n",
      "the exercise which called him out in the morning was\n",
      "almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day\n",
      "was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\n",
      "favourite pointer at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening in particular, about a week after\n",
      "Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed\n",
      "more than usually open to every feeling of attachment\n",
      "to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's\n",
      "happening to mention her design of improving the cottage\n",
      "in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration\n",
      "of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!\n",
      "No. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must\n",
      "be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,\n",
      "if my feelings are regarded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "\"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother\n",
      "will never have money enough to attempt it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am heartily glad of it,\" he cried.  \"May she\n",
      "always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I\n",
      "would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\n",
      "of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements\n",
      "in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed\n",
      "sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring,\n",
      "I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\n",
      "of it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really\n",
      "so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am,\" said he.  \"To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,\n",
      "I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\n",
      "is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull\n",
      "Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this\n",
      "cottage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,\n",
      "I suppose,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all\n",
      "and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience\n",
      "or INconvenience about it, should the least variation\n",
      "be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I\n",
      "might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I flatter myself,\" replied Elinor, \"that even under\n",
      "the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase,\n",
      "you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\n",
      "now do this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby,\n",
      "\"which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will\n",
      "always have one claim of my affection, which no other can\n",
      "possibly share.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne,\n",
      "whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby,\n",
      "as plainly denoted how well she understood him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How often did I wish,\" added he, \"when I was at\n",
      "Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were\n",
      "inhabited!  I never passed within view of it without admiring\n",
      "its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it.\n",
      "How little did I then think that the very first news\n",
      "I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into\n",
      "the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I\n",
      "felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event,\n",
      "which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I\n",
      "should experience from it, can account for.  Must it not have\n",
      "been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered voice.\n",
      "Then continuing his former tone, he said, \"And yet this\n",
      "house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it\n",
      "of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear\n",
      "parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which\n",
      "so many happy hours have been since spent by us together,\n",
      "you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\n",
      "and every body would be eager to pass through the room\n",
      "which has hitherto contained within itself more real\n",
      "accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\n",
      "the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration\n",
      "of the kind should be attempted.\n",
      "\n",

      "the next day, and two of her daughters went with her;\n",

      "had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;\n",
      "but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\n",
      "had taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in the\n",

      "apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief\n",
      "at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\n",
      "Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\n",
      "she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,\n",
      "who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back\n",
      "towards them.  He turned round on their coming in,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.\n",

      "of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on\n",
      "business to London.  I have just received my dispatches,\n",
      "and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration\n",
      "I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To London!--and are you going this morning?\"\n",

      "on the ground he only replied, \"You are too good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.\n",
      "Elinor felt equal amazement.  For a few moments every one\n",
      "was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at\n",
      "Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not\n",
      "press you to return here immediately, because you only\n",
      "can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;\n",

      "your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "myself\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished\n",
      "to speak, and another pause succeeded.  This was broken\n",
      "by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, \"It is folly\n",
      "to linger in this manner.  I will not torment myself\n",
      "any longer by remaining among friends whose society\n",
      "it is impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He then hastily took leave of them all and left\n",
      "the room.  They saw him step into his carriage,\n",
      "and in a minute it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly\n",
      "quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\n",
      "and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.\n",
      "She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.\n",
      "Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his\n",
      "embarrassment,\n",
      "and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his\n",
      "unwillingness\n",
      "to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a\n",
      "lover,\n",
      "so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared\n",
      "that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the\n",
      "next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\n",
      "and\n",
      "her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room\n",
      "was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for,\n",
      "though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was,\n",
      "a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whatever might be the particulars of their separation,\n",
      "her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought\n",
      "with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\n",
      "which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving\n",
      "way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In about half an hour her mother returned, and though\n",
      "her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\"\n",
      "said she, as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart\n",
      "does he travel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It\n",
      "seems but the work of a moment.  And last night he was\n",
      "with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate?  And now,\n",
      "after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending\n",
      "to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must\n",
      "have happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave\n",
      "like himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.\n",
      "What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else should he\n",
      "have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could\n",
      "plainly see THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.\n",
      "I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can\n",
      "perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\n",
      "strange to me as well as to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can you, indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most\n",

      "where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you\n",
      "shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am persuaded\n",
      "that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne,\n",
      "disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views\n",
      "for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--\n",
      "and that the business which she sends him off to transact\n",
      "is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I\n",
      "believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she\n",
      "DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore\n",
      "at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,\n",
      "and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation,\n",
      "to give into her schemes, and absent himself from\n",
      "Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,\n",
      "that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen\n",
      "to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method\n",
      "of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this.\n",
      "And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not\n",
      "have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your\n",
      "feelings!  You had rather take evil upon credit than good.\n",
      "You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt\n",
      "for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter.\n",
      "You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took\n",
      "leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\n",
      "has shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,\n",
      "or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are\n",
      "no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they\n",
      "are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we\n",
      "have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world\n",
      "to think ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable\n",
      "in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,\n",
      "after all, what is it you suspect him of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of\n",
      "something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\n",
      "of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him.\n",
      "There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged\n",
      "of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it\n",
      "is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body.\n",
      "Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\n",
      "reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\n",
      "But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge\n",
      "them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I\n",
      "cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from\n",
      "his character, where the deviation is necessary.\n",

      "in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their\n",
      "engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--\n",
      "and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient\n",
      "for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse\n",
      "Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange\n",
      "indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day\n",

      "spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour to Marianne\n",
      "and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight,\n",
      "declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife,\n",
      "and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\n",
      "relation?  Have we not perfectly understood each other?\n",
      "Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner,\n",
      "his attentive and affectionate respect?  My Elinor,\n",
      "is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How could\n",
      "such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed\n",
      "that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your\n",
      "sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps\n",
      "for months, without telling her of his affection;--that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance\n",

      "but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject,\n",
      "and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed\n",
      "of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,\n",
      "you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together.\n",
      "Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\n",
      "all this time?  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never\n",
      "considered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,\n",
      "I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they\n",
      "may soon be entirely done away.  If we find they correspond,\n",
      "every fear of mine will be removed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see\n",

      "Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt;\n",
      "no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open\n",
      "and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.\n",
      "It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?\n",

      "manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself,\n",
      "and did not return your kindness with any cordiality.\n",
      "But all this may be explained by such a situation of his\n",

      "my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction;\n",
      "and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,\n",
      "to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet\n",
      "aware that by declining your invitation, by saying\n",
      "that he was going away for some time, he should seem\n",
      "to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family,\n",
      "be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,\n",
      "a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\n",
      "more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent\n",
      "with his general character;--but I will not raise objections\n",
      "against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,\n",
      "as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from\n",
      "what I may think right and consistent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does\n",
      "not deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not known\n",
      "him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world;\n",
      "and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  Had he been\n",
      "in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\n",
      "it might have been odd that he should leave us without\n",
      "acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case.\n",
      "It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun,\n",

      "than when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which\n",
      "made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger\n",
      "of incurring it.  She was awake the whole night, and she\n",
      "wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a headache,\n",
      "was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\n",

      "had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing\n",
      "on every line of music that he had written out for her,\n",
      "till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\n",
      "could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every\n",
      "day applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte\n",
      "alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally\n",
      "suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music,\n",
      "she courted the misery which a contrast between the past\n",

      "occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected\n",
      "by Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again\n",

      "could not give offence.  It would be the natural result\n",
      "of your affection for her.  She used to be all unreserve,\n",
      "and to you more especially.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would not ask such a question for the world.\n",
      "Supposing it possible that they are not engaged,\n",
      "what distress would not such an enquiry inflict!  At any\n",
      "rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never deserve\n",
      "her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession\n",
      "of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.\n",
      "I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me,\n",
      "and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\n",
      "known,\n",
      "when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible.\n",
      "I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one;\n",
      "of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent\n",
      "the denial which her wishes might direct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,\n",
      "considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther,\n",
      "but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence,\n",
      "were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was several days before Willoughby's name\n",
      "was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;\n",
      "Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice;\n",
      "their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--\n",
      "but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a\n",
      "volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear\n",
      "Willoughby went away before we could get through it.\n",
      "We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may\n",
      "be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Months!\" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.\n",
      "\"No--nor many weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;\n",
      "but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply\n",
      "from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby\n",
      "and knowledge of his intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about a week after his leaving the country,\n",
      "Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\n",
      "usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.\n",
      "Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\n",
      "her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\n",
      "she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked\n",
      "of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills,\n",
      "and could never be found when the others set off.\n",
      "But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor,\n",
      "who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.  They walked\n",
      "along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\n",
      "for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor,\n",
      "satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.\n",
      "Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country,\n",
      "though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long\n",
      "stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\n",
      "to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\n",
      "they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect\n",
      "which formed the distance of their view from the cottage,\n",
      "from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\n",
      "of their walks before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered\n",
      "an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them.\n",
      "In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman;\n",
      "and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was\n",
      "hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is\n",
      "not Willoughby.  The person is not tall enough for him,\n",
      "and has not his air.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.\n",
      "His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,\n",
      "to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost\n",
      "certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her\n",
      "pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within\n",
      "thirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again;\n",
      "her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round,\n",
      "she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters\n",
      "were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known\n",
      "as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop,\n",
      "and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\n",
      "Edward Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the only person in the world who could\n",
      "at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby;\n",
      "the only one who could have gained a smile from her;\n",
      "but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her\n",
      "sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant,\n",
      "walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely\n",
      "coming to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality,\n",
      "but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of\n",
      "regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.\n",
      "To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister\n",
      "was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\n",
      "had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.\n",
      "On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency\n",
      "of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.\n",
      "He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\n",
      "in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,\n",
      "said little but what was forced from him by questions,\n",
      "and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.\n",
      "Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise.\n",
      "She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended,\n",
      "as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her\n",
      "thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast\n",
      "sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short silence which succeeded the first\n",
      "surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked\n",
      "Edward if he came directly from London.  No, he had\n",
      "been in Devonshire a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being\n",
      "so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing\n",
      "her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked rather distressed as he added, that he\n",
      "had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks\n",
      "much as it always does at this time of the year.\n",
      "The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation\n",
      "have I formerly seen them fall!  How have I delighted,\n",
      "as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me\n",
      "by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season, the air\n",
      "altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.\n",
      "They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off,\n",
      "and driven as much as possible from the sight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your\n",
      "passion for dead leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often\n",
      "understood.  But SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this,\n",
      "she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing\n",
      "herself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she, calling his attention\n",
      "to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley.  Look up to it,\n",
      "and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!\n",
      "Did you ever see their equals?  To the left is Barton park,\n",
      "amongst those woods and plantations.  You may see the end\n",
      "of the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill,\n",
      "which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these\n",
      "bottoms must be dirty in winter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the\n",
      "objects before me, I see a very dirty lane.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the\n",
      "Middletons pleasant people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not all,\" answered Marianne; \"we could not\n",
      "be more unfortunately situated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can\n",
      "you be so unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr.\n",
      "Ferrars;\n",
      "and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you\n",
      "forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many\n",
      "painful moments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor took no notice of this; and directing\n",
      "her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support\n",
      "something like discourse with him, by talking of their\n",
      "present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him\n",
      "occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve\n",
      "mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry;\n",
      "but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\n",
      "rather than the present, she avoided every appearance\n",
      "of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she\n",
      "thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\n",

      "CHAPTER 17\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at\n",
      "seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,\n",
      "of all things the most natural.  Her joy and expression\n",
      "of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received the kindest\n",
      "welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\n",
      "stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him\n",
      "before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome\n",
      "by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man\n",
      "could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,\n",
      "without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the\n",
      "satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.\n",
      "His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all,\n",
      "and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.\n",
      "He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house,\n",
      "admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still\n",
      "he was not in spirits.  The whole family perceived it,\n",
      "and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality\n",
      "in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\n",
      "selfish parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?\"\n",
      "said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round\n",
      "the fire; \"are you still to be a great orator in spite of\n",
      "yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have\n",
      "no more talents than inclination for a public life!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you\n",
      "must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination\n",
      "for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession,\n",
      "and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be\n",
      "distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall.\n",
      "Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes\n",
      "are all moderate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world,\n",
      "I believe.  I wish as well as every body else to be\n",
      "perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be\n",
      "in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange that it would!\" cried Marianne.  \"What have\n",
      "wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandeur has but little,\" said Elinor, \"but wealth\n",
      "has much to do with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only\n",
      "give happiness where there is nothing else to give it.\n",
      "Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,\n",
      "as far as mere self is concerned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come\n",
      "to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY wealth\n",
      "are very much alike, I dare say; and without them,\n",
      "as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every\n",
      "kind of external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas\n",
      "are only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year;\n",
      "not more than THAT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor laughed.  \"TWO thousand a year! ONE is my\n",
      "wealth! I guessed how it would end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,\"\n",
      "said Marianne.  \"A family cannot well be maintained on\n",
      "a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands.\n",
      "A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,\n",
      "and hunters, cannot be supported on less.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing\n",
      "so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hunters!\" repeated Edward--\"but why must you have\n",
      "hunters?  Every body does not hunt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne coloured as she replied, \"But most people do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought,\n",
      "\"that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh that they would!\" cried Marianne, her eyes\n",
      "sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing\n",
      "with the delight of such imaginary happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, \"in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear!\" cried Margaret, \"how happy I should be!\n",
      "I wonder what I should do with it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Dashwood, \"if my children were all to be rich\n",
      "my help.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must begin your improvements on this house,\"\n",
      "observed Elinor, \"and your difficulties will soon vanish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What magnificent orders would travel from this family\n",
      "to London,\" said Edward, \"in such an event!  What a happy\n",
      "day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops!  You,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every\n",
      "new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne,\n",
      "I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough\n",
      "in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\n",
      "Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she\n",
      "would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their\n",
      "falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every\n",
      "book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\n",
      "Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very saucy.\n",
      "But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our\n",
      "old disputes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it\n",
      "be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it--and you\n",
      "will never offend me by talking of former times.\n",
      "You are very right in supposing how my money would be\n",
      "spent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly\n",
      "be employed in improving my collection of music and books.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\n",
      "in annuities on the authors or their heirs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Edward, I should have something else to do\n",
      "with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that\n",
      "person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim,\n",
      "that no one can ever be in love more than once in their\n",
      "life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.\n",
      "It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to\n",
      "change them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,\" said Elinor,\n",
      "\"she is not at all altered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is only grown a little more grave than she was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Edward,\" said Marianne, \"you need not reproach me.\n",
      "You are not very gay yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you think so!\" replied he, with a sigh.\n",
      "\"But gaiety never was a part of MY character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,\" said Elinor;\n",
      "\"I should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest,\n",
      "very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal\n",
      "and always with animation--but she is not often really merry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, \"and yet I\n",
      "have always set her down as a lively girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, \"in a total misapprehension of character in some\n",
      "point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave,\n",
      "or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can\n",
      "hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.\n",
      "Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,\n",
      "and very frequently by what other people say of them,\n",
      "without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I thought it was right, Elinor,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "\"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.\n",
      "I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\n",
      "to those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,\n",
      "I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed\n",
      "at the subjection of the understanding.  All I have\n",
      "ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour.\n",
      "You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,\n",
      "of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\n",
      "in general with greater attention; but when have I advised\n",
      "you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\n",
      "judgment in serious matters?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your\n",
      "plan of general civility,\" said Edward to Elinor, \"Do you gain\n",
      "no ground?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite the contrary,\" replied Elinor,\n",
      "looking expressively at Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My judgment,\" he returned, \"is all on your side\n",
      "of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much\n",
      "more on your sister's.  I never wish to offend, but I\n",
      "am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent,\n",
      "when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.\n",
      "I have frequently thought that I must have been intended\n",
      "by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at\n",
      "my ease among strangers of gentility!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention\n",
      "of hers,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She knows her own worth too well for false shame,\"\n",
      "replied Edward.  \"Shyness is only the effect of a sense\n",
      "of inferiority in some way or other.  If I could persuade\n",
      "myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,\n",
      "I should not be shy.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "of her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very\n",
      "partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it\n",
      "appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;\n",
      "she wished it were equally evident that he still\n",
      "distinguished her by the same affection which once\n",
      "she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the\n",
      "continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain;\n",
      "and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\n",

      "the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne,\n",
      "who was always eager to promote their happiness as far\n",
      "as she could, soon left them to themselves.  But before she\n",
      "was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and,\n",
      "turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.\n",

      "Edward returned to them with fresh admiration\n",
      "of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village,\n",
      "he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage;\n",
      "and the village itself, in a much higher situation than\n",
      "the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\n",
      "exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured\n",
      "Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe\n",
      "her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more\n",
      "minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him,\n",
      "when Edward interrupted her by saying, \"You must not\n",
      "enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge\n",
      "in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance\n",
      "and want of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call\n",
      "hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange\n",
      "and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged;\n",
      "and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\n",
      "indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.\n",
      "You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can\n",
      "honestly give.  I call it a very fine country--the\n",
      "hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\n",
      "and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich\n",
      "meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\n",
      "and there.  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country,\n",
      "because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it\n",
      "is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can\n",
      "easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories,\n",
      "grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I suspect,\" said Elinor, \"that to avoid one kind\n",
      "of affectation, Edward here falls into another.  Because he\n",
      "believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\n",
      "of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with\n",
      "such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less\n",
      "discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses.\n",
      "He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration\n",

      "Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\n",
      "the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\n",
      "picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind,\n",
      "and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,\n",
      "because I could find no language to describe them\n",
      "in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am convinced,\" said Edward, \"that you really feel\n",
      "all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\n",
      "to feel.  But, in return, your sister must allow me\n",
      "to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,\n",
      "but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked,\n",
      "twisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they\n",
      "are tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,\n",
      "tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles or thistles,\n",
      "or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a snug\n",
      "farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,\n",

      "with compassion at her sister.  Elinor only laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne\n",
      "remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly\n",
      "engaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and\n",
      "in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed\n",
      "so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\n",
      "of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,\" she cried.\n",

      "you some.  But I should have thought her hair had been darker.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--\n",
      "but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own\n",
      "vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\n",
      "by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary\n",
      "glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister's hair.\n",
      "The setting always casts a different shade on it,\n",
      "you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.\n",
      "That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as\n",
      "well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their\n",
      "conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free\n",
      "gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been\n",
      "procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\n",
      "She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,\n",
      "and affecting to take no notice of what passed,\n",
      "by instantly talking of something else, she internally\n",
      "resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\n",
      "the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt,\n",
      "that it was exactly the shade of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it\n",
      "ended in an absence of mind still more settled.\n",
      "He was particularly grave the whole morning.\n",
      "Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said;\n",

      "Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of\n",

      "of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but\n",
      "the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have\n",
      "prevented from being immediately sprung.  But, as it was,\n",

      "for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards\n",

      "\n",

      "at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it\n",
      "to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general,\n",
      "founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby\n",

      "pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he\n",
      "were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved\n",
      "to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\n",
      "the height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,\n",
      "though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew\n",
      "more and more partial to the house and environs--never\n",
      "spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time\n",
      "to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he\n",
      "should go when he left them--but still, go he must.\n",
      "Never had any week passed so quickly--he could hardly\n",
      "believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; other things\n",
      "he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave\n",
      "the lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland;\n",
      "he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London,\n",
      "he must go.  He valued their kindness beyond any thing,\n",
      "and his greatest happiness was in being with them.\n",
      "Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite\n",
      "of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint\n",
      "on his time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this\n",
      "way of acting to his mother's account; and it was\n",
      "happy for her that he had a mother whose character\n",
      "was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general\n",
      "excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.\n",
      "Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes\n",
      "displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself,\n",
      "she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\n",
      "with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\n",
      "which had been rather more painfully extorted from her,\n",
      "for Willoughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,\n",
      "of openness, and of consistency, were most usually\n",
      "attributed to his want of independence, and his better\n",
      "knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs.\n",
      "The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\n",
      "in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination,\n",
      "the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.\n",
      "The old well-established grievance of duty against will,\n",
      "parent against child, was the cause of all.  She would have\n",
      "been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease,\n",
      "this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would\n",
      "be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.\n",
      "But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\n",
      "to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,\n",
      "to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\n",
      "which fell from him while at Barton, and above all\n",
      "to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\n",
      "round his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, Edward,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were\n",
      "at breakfast the last morning, \"you would be a happier man\n",
      "if you had any profession to engage your time and give\n",
      "an interest to your plans and actions.  Some inconvenience\n",
      "to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you\n",
      "would not be able to give them so much of your time.\n",
      "But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited\n",
      "in one particular at least--you would know where to go\n",
      "when you left them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do assure you,\" he replied, \"that I have long\n",
      "thought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,\n",
      "and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\n",
      "to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me,\n",
      "no profession to give me employment, or afford me any\n",
      "thing like independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety,\n",
      "and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am,\n",
      "an idle, helpless being.  We never could agree in our\n",
      "choice of a profession.  I always preferred the church,\n",
      "as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.\n",
      "They recommended the army.  That was a great deal\n",
      "too smart for me.  The law was allowed to be genteel\n",
      "enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple,\n",
      "made a very good appearance in the first circles,\n",
      "and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had\n",
      "no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse\n",
      "study of it, which my family approved.  As for the navy,\n",
      "it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\n",
      "subject was first started to enter it--and, at length,\n",
      "as there was no necessity for my having any profession\n",
      "at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without\n",
      "a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced\n",
      "on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable,\n",
      "and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\n",
      "bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\n",
      "friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford\n",
      "and have been properly idle ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\"\n",
      "said Mrs. Dashwood, \"since leisure has not promoted\n",
      "your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up\n",
      "to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\n",
      "as Columella's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent,\n",
      "\"to be as unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling,\n",
      "in action, in condition, in every thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate\n",
      "want of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,\n",
      "and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.\n",
      "But remember that the pain of parting from friends\n",
      "will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\n",
      "education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want\n",
      "nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name,\n",
      "call it hope.  Your mother will secure to you, in time,\n",
      "that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,\n",
      "and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\n",
      "prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.\n",
      "How much may not a few months do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" replied Edward, \"that I may defy many\n",
      "months to produce any good to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This desponding turn of mind, though it could not\n",
      "be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain\n",
      "to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,\n",
      "and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's\n",
      "feelings especially, which required some trouble and time\n",
      "to subdue.  But as it was her determination to subdue it,\n",
      "and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\n",
      "what all her family suffered on his going away, she did\n",
      "not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,\n",
      "on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow,\n",
      "by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means\n",
      "were as different as their objects, and equally suited\n",
      "to the advancement of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he\n",
      "was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day,\n",
      "neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name,\n",
      "appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\n",
      "general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct,\n",
      "she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\n",
      "from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters\n",
      "were spared much solicitude on her account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse\n",
      "of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,\n",
      "than her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business\n",
      "of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong\n",
      "affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could\n",
      "have no merit.  That her sister's affections WERE calm,\n",
      "she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it;\n",
      "and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof,\n",
      "by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite\n",
      "of this mortifying conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without shutting herself up from her family,\n",
      "or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,\n",
      "or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation,\n",
      "Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\n",
      "to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every\n",
      "possible variety which the different state of her spirits\n",
      "at different times could produce,--with tenderness,\n",
      "pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  There were moments\n",
      "in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother\n",
      "and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\n",
      "conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect\n",
      "of solitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitably\n",
      "at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere;\n",
      "and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting,\n",
      "must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\n",
      "her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her\n",
      "drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after\n",
      "Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company.\n",
      "She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the\n",
      "little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front\n",
      "of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw\n",

      "were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were\n",
      "quite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,\n",
      "and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest\n",
      "of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,\n",
      "and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the\n",
      "casement to speak to him, though the space was so short\n",
      "between the door and the window, as to make it hardly\n",
      "possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said he, \"we have brought you some strangers.\n",
      "How do you like them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hush! they will hear you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.\n",
      "Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her\n",
      "if you look this way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\n",
      "of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged\n",
      "to be excused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we\n",
      "are come? I see her instrument is open.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is walking, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not\n",
      "patience enough to wait till the door was opened before\n",
      "she told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,\n",
      "\"How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs. Dashwood do?\n",
      "And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you\n",
      "will be glad of a little company to sit with you.\n",
      "I have brought my other son and daughter to see you.\n",
      "Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I thought I heard\n",
      "a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\n",
      "but it never entered my head that it could be them.\n",
      "I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel\n",
      "Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think\n",
      "I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come\n",
      "back again\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle\n",
      "of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady\n",
      "Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they\n",
      "all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "continued her story as she walked through the passage\n",
      "into the parlour, attended by Sir John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady\n",
      "Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect.\n",
      "She was short and plump, had a very pretty face,\n",
      "and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\n",
      "possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant\n",
      "as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing.\n",
      "She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit,\n",
      "except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away.\n",
      "Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\n",
      "and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than\n",
      "his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased.\n",
      "He entered the room with a look of self-consequence,\n",
      "slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word,\n",
      "and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments,\n",
      "took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it\n",
      "as long as he staid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed\n",
      "by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy,\n",
      "was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\n",
      "and every thing in it burst forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never\n",
      "saw anything so charming!  Only think, Mamma, how it\n",
      "is improved since I was here last! I always thought it\n",
      "such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\n",
      "but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister,\n",
      "how delightful every thing is! How I should like such\n",
      "a house for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise\n",
      "his eyes from the newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer does not hear me,\" said she, laughing;\n",
      "\"he never does sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had\n",
      "never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one,\n",
      "and could not help looking with surprise at them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud\n",
      "as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,\n",
      "the evening before, on seeing their friends, without\n",
      "ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer laughed\n",
      "heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,\n",
      "and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it\n",
      "had been quite an agreeable surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,\"\n",
      "added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor,\n",
      "and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\n",
      "by no one else, though they were seated on different sides\n",
      "of the room; \"but, however, I can't help wishing they had\n",
      "not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey\n",
      "of it, for they came all round by London upon account\n",
      "of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and\n",
      "pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation.\n",
      "I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning,\n",
      "but she would come with us; she longed so much to see\n",
      "you all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her\n",
      "any harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She expects to be confined in February,\"\n",
      "continued Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation,\n",
      "and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there\n",
      "was any news in the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, none at all,\" he replied, and read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here comes Marianne,\" cried Sir John.  \"Now, Palmer,\n",
      "you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,\n",
      "and ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her,\n",
      "as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham;\n",
      "and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question,\n",
      "as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up\n",
      "on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes,\n",
      "and then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye\n",
      "was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room.\n",
      "She got up to examine them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!\n",
      "Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming;\n",
      "I could look at them for ever.\" And then sitting down again,\n",
      "she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer\n",
      "rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself\n",
      "and looked at them all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love, have you been asleep?\" said his wife, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made her no answer; and only observed, after again\n",
      "examining the room, that it was very low pitched,\n",
      "and that the ceiling was crooked.  He then made his bow,\n",
      "and departed with the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir John had been very urgent with them all to\n",
      "spend the next day at the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did\n",
      "not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\n",
      "at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\n",
      "her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no\n",
      "curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner,\n",
      "and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way.\n",
      "They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves;\n",
      "the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good.\n",
      "But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should\n",
      "be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too,\n",
      "though she did not press their mother, pressed them.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all\n",
      "seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young\n",
      "ladies were obliged to yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should they ask us?\" said Marianne, as soon as they\n",
      "were gone.  \"The rent of this cottage is said to be low;\n",
      "but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine\n",
      "at the park whenever any one is staying either with them,\n",
      "or with us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,\"\n",
      "said Elinor, \"by these frequent invitations, than by\n",
      "those which we received from them a few weeks ago.\n",
      "The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown\n",
      "tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere.\"\n",

      "As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park\n",
      "the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at\n",
      "the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before.\n",
      "She took them all most affectionately by the hand,\n",
      "and expressed great delight in seeing them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad to see you!\" said she, seating herself\n",
      "between Elinor and Marianne, \"for it is so bad a day I was\n",
      "afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing,\n",
      "as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons\n",
      "come to us next week you know.  It was quite a sudden thing\n",
      "our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage\n",
      "was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\n",
      "would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never\n",
      "tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;\n",
      "however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not go to town!\" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,\n",
      "\"I shall be quite disappointed if you do not.  I could\n",
      "get the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,\n",
      "in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I am sure\n",
      "I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\n",

      "\n",
      "Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing\n",
      "to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How horrid all this is!\" said he.  \"Such weather\n",
      "makes every thing and every body disgusting.  Dullness\n",
      "is as much produced within doors as without, by rain.\n",
      "It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  What the\n",
      "devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room\n",
      "in his house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir\n",
      "John is as stupid as the weather.\"\n",

      "Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't be so sly before us,\" said Mrs. Palmer;\n",
      "\"for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your\n",

      "We do not live a great way from him in the country, you know.\n",
      "Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, well! there is not much difference.\n",
      "I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet\n",
      "pretty place.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear,\" said he to his lady, \"it is very provoking\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me\n",

      "\"You and I, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Jennings,\n",

      "your mother ill-bred.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,\" said the good-natured\n",
      "old lady, \"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot\n",
      "give her back again.  So there I have the whip hand of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her\n",
      "husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said,\n",
      "she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must\n",
      "live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more\n",
      "thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy\n",
      "than Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,\n",
      "and discontent of her husband gave her no pain;\n",
      "and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper,\n",
      "to Elinor.  \"He is always out of humour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation,\n",
      "to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\n",
      "ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.\n",
      "His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,\n",
      "like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\n",
      "bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\n",
      "woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too\n",
      "common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.--\n",
      "It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed,\n",
      "which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body,\n",
      "and his general abuse of every thing before him.\n",
      "It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.\n",
      "The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means,\n",
      "however they might succeed by establishing his superiority\n",
      "in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him\n",
      "except his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,\n",
      "\"I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.\n",
      "Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this\n",
      "Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are\n",
      "with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!  It will\n",

      "\"don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" he replied, with a sneer--\"I came\n",
      "into Devonshire with no other view.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer\n",
      "expects you; so you cannot refuse to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you\n",
      "will like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,\n",
      "and it will be quite delightful.  You cannot think\n",
      "what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now,\n",
      "for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\n",
      "against the election; and so many people came to dine\n",
      "with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!  But,\n",
      "poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced\n",
      "to make every body like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\n",
      "assented to the hardship of such an obligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he\n",
      "is in Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will\n",
      "be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\n",
      "with an M.P.--But do you know, he says, he will never frank\n",
      "for me?  He declares he won't.  Don't you, Mr. Palmer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--\n",
      "\"he says it is quite shocking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational.\n",
      "Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always\n",
      "the way with him!  Sometimes he won't speak to me for half\n",
      "a day together, and then he comes out with something\n",
      "so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She surprised Elinor very much as they returned\n",
      "into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did\n",
      "not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would,\n",
      "he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased\n",
      "with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't\n",
      "think how disappointed he will be if you don't come\n",
      "to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object\n",
      "to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation;\n",
      "and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties.\n",
      "She thought it probable that as they lived in the\n",
      "same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\n",
      "more particular account of Willoughby's general\n",
      "character, than could be gathered from the Middletons'\n",
      "partial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain\n",
      "from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might\n",
      "remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began\n",
      "by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland,\n",
      "and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\"\n",
      "replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not that I ever spoke\n",
      "to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.\n",
      "Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton\n",
      "while he was at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--\n",
      "but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  However, I dare say\n",
      "we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,\n",
      "if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\n",
      "have been in the country together.  He is very little\n",
      "at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,\n",
      "I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is\n",
      "in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a\n",
      "way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very well;\n",
      "your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it,\n",
      "for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much\n",
      "more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon\n",
      "Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town,\n",
      "and he told me of it directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell\n",
      "you of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  To give such\n",
      "intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it,\n",
      "even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel\n",
      "Brandon to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that,\n",
      "and I will tell you how it happened.  When we met him,\n",
      "he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking\n",
      "of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\n",
      "and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family\n",
      "come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word\n",
      "they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be\n",
      "married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.  Is it true,\n",
      "pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he\n",

      "an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it\n",

      "\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe\n",
      "many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna\n",
      "is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable\n",
      "I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.\n",
      "She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;\n",
      "not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,\n",
      "because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing\n",
      "can be good enough for her.  However, I don't think\n",
      "her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;\n",
      "for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does\n",
      "Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him\n",
      "to own it last night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby\n",
      "was not very material; but any testimony in his favour,\n",

      "\"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,\"\n",
      "continued Charlotte.--\"And now I hope we shall always be\n",

      "glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John and Lady\n",
      "Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think\n",
      "the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day,\n",
      "and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain\n",
      "each other.  But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly\n",
      "got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done\n",
      "wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause,\n",
      "at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities,\n",
      "and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\n",
      "husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some\n",
      "other new acquaintance to see and observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with\n",
      "two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction\n",
      "of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough\n",
      "for Sir John to invite them directly to the park,\n",
      "as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\n",
      "Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before\n",
      "such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into\n",
      "no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing\n",
      "that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\n",
      "whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,--\n",
      "whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof;\n",
      "for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\n",
      "went for nothing at all.  Their being her relations too\n",
      "made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts\n",
      "at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,\n",
      "when she advised her daughter not to care about their being\n",
      "so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\n",
      "up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to\n",
      "prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the\n",
      "idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,\n",
      "contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\n",
      "reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by\n",
      "no means ungenteel or unfashionable.  Their dress was\n",
      "very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted\n",
      "with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\n",
      "and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\n",
      "that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their\n",
      "favour before they had been an hour at the Park.\n",
      "She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed,\n",
      "which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.\n",
      "Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this\n",
      "animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage\n",
      "to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,\n",
      "and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\n",
      "in the world.  From such commendation as this, however,\n",
      "there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew\n",
      "that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\n",
      "with in every part of England, under every possible\n",
      "variation of form, face, temper and understanding.\n",
      "Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly\n",
      "and look at his guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It\n",
      "was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I\n",
      "declare you shall come--You can't think how you will\n",
      "like them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured\n",
      "and agreeable!  The children are all hanging about her already,\n",
      "as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they both long\n",
      "to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter\n",
      "that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world;\n",
      "and I have told them it is all very true, and a great\n",
      "deal more.  You will be delighted with them I am sure.\n",
      "They have brought the whole coach full of playthings\n",
      "for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?\n",
      "Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.\n",
      "YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must\n",
      "be related.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain\n",
      "a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two,\n",
      "and then left them in amazement at their indifference,\n",
      "to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\n",
      "Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss\n",
      "Steeles to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When their promised visit to the Park and consequent\n",
      "introduction to these young ladies took place, they found\n",
      "in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,\n",
      "with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire;\n",
      "but in the other, who was not more than two or three\n",
      "and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her\n",
      "features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,\n",
      "and a smartness of air, which though it did not give\n",
      "actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.--\n",
      "Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\n",
      "allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she\n",
      "saw with what constant and judicious attention they\n",
      "were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton.\n",
      "With her children they were in continual raptures,\n",
      "extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring\n",
      "their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from\n",
      "the importunate demands which this politeness made on it,\n",
      "was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing,\n",
      "if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns\n",
      "of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance\n",
      "the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\n",
      "Fortunately for those who pay their court through\n",
      "such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise\n",
      "for her children, the most rapacious of human beings,\n",
      "is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant;\n",
      "but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\n",
      "affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards\n",
      "her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton\n",
      "without the smallest surprise or distrust.  She saw with\n",
      "maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\n",
      "and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\n",
      "She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about\n",
      "their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives\n",
      "and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being\n",
      "a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other surprise\n",
      "than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\n",
      "without claiming a share in what was passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his\n",
      "taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing\n",
      "it out of window--\"He is full of monkey tricks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently\n",
      "pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed,\n",
      "\"How playful William is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added,\n",
      "tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old,\n",
      "who had not made a noise for the last two minutes;\n",
      "\"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there\n",
      "such a quiet little thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,\n",
      "a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching\n",
      "the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness\n",
      "such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any\n",
      "creature professedly noisy.  The mother's consternation\n",
      "was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the\n",
      "Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three,\n",
      "in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest\n",
      "as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer.\n",
      "She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses,\n",
      "her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the\n",
      "Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her,\n",
      "and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other.\n",
      "With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise\n",
      "to cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily,\n",
      "kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all\n",
      "their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton\n",
      "luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress\n",
      "last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully\n",
      "applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\n",
      "proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight\n",
      "intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it,\n",
      "gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.--\n",
      "She was carried out of the room therefore in her\n",
      "mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the\n",
      "two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated\n",
      "by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies\n",
      "were left in a quietness which the room had not known for\n",
      "many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon\n",
      "as they were gone.  \"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it\n",
      "had been under totally different circumstances.\n",
      "But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there\n",
      "is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say\n",
      "what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;\n",
      "and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies\n",
      "when politeness required it, always fell.  She did her\n",
      "best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton\n",
      "with more warmth than she felt, though with far less than\n",
      "Miss Lucy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister,\n",
      "\"what a charming man he is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only\n",
      "simple and just, came in without any eclat.  She merely\n",
      "observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what a charming little family they have!  I\n",
      "never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I\n",
      "quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always\n",
      "distractedly fond of children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile,\n",
      "\"from what I have witnessed this morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little\n",
      "Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the\n",
      "outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton;\n",
      "and for my part, I love to see children full of life\n",
      "and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at\n",
      "Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children\n",
      "with any abhorrence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first\n",
      "broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed\n",
      "for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly,\n",
      "\"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?  I suppose\n",
      "you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In some surprise at the familiarity of this question,\n",
      "or at least of the manner in which it was spoken,\n",
      "Elinor replied that she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\"\n",
      "added Miss Steele.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\"\n",
      "said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary\n",
      "for the freedom of her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think every one MUST admire it,\" replied Elinor,\n",
      "\"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed\n",
      "that any one can estimate its beauties as we do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I\n",
      "suppose you have not so many in this part of the world;\n",
      "for my part, I think they are a vast addition always.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed\n",
      "of her sister, \"that there are not as many genteel young\n",
      "men in Devonshire as Sussex?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there\n",
      "an't.  I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter;\n",
      "but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there\n",
      "might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not\n",
      "so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies\n",
      "may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without\n",
      "them as with them.  For my part, I think they are vastly\n",
      "agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil.\n",
      "But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.  Now there's\n",
      "Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man,\n",
      "quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you\n",
      "do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.--\n",
      "I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "before he married, as he was so rich?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you,\n",
      "for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.\n",
      "But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before\n",
      "he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest\n",
      "alteration in him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being\n",
      "beaux--they have something else to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of\n",
      "nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you\n",
      "think of nothing else.\" And then to turn the discourse,\n",
      "she began admiring the house and the furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.\n",
      "The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\n",
      "her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded\n",
      "by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest,\n",
      "to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left\n",
      "the house without any wish of knowing them better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well\n",
      "provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,\n",
      "his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly\n",
      "proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they\n",
      "declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished,\n",
      "and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\n",
      "they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.--\n",
      "And to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found\n",
      "was their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely\n",
      "on the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be\n",
      "too strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy\n",
      "must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour\n",
      "or two together in the same room almost every day.\n",
      "Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any\n",
      "more was required: to be together was, in his opinion,\n",
      "to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\n",
      "meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being\n",
      "established friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do him justice, he did every thing in his power\n",
      "to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles\n",
      "acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins'\n",
      "situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor\n",

      "Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more\n",
      "nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward,\n",
      "than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was\n",
      "rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat\n",
      "newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit,\n",
      "they had never dined together without his drinking to her\n",

      "her want of information in the most common particulars,\n",
      "could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her\n",
      "constant endeavour to appear to advantage.  Elinor saw,\n",
      "and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education\n",
      "might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less\n",
      "tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy,\n",
      "of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions,\n",
      "her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" replied Lucy; \"I wonder at that, for I\n",

      "she is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real\n",
      "opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous\n",
      "of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity--\n",
      "\"I know nothing of her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring\n",

      "as she spoke; \"but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish\n",
      "I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice\n",
      "of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on\n",
      "for a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,\n",
      "who renewed the subject again by saying, with some\n",
      "hesitation,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.\n",
      "I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be\n",
      "thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\n",
      "having as yours.  And I am sure I should not have the smallest\n",
      "fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your\n",

      "with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,\n",
      "I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all\n",
      "wonder at it.  But if I dared tell you all, you would not be\n",
      "so much surprised.  Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me\n",
      "at present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come\n",
      "must depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately\n",
      "connected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,\n",
      "with only one side glance at her companion to observe its\n",
      "effect on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elinor, \"what do you mean?\n",
      "Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?\"\n",

      "a sister-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Lucy, \"not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I\n",
      "never saw him in my life; but,\" fixing her eyes upon Elinor,\n",
      "\"to his eldest brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,\n",
      "that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not\n",
      "an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it.\n",
      "She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine\n",
      "the reason or object of such a declaration; and though\n",
      "her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity,\n",
      "and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy;\n",
      "\"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before;\n",
      "for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\n",
      "to you or any of your family; because it was always meant\n",
      "to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully\n",
      "kept so by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations\n",
      "know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned\n",
      "it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence\n",
      "in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my\n",
      "behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.\n",
      "And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,\n",
      "when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has\n",
      "the highest opinion in the world of all your family,\n",
      "and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite\n",
      "as his own sisters.\"--She paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor for a few moments remained silent.\n",
      "Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too\n",
      "great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak,\n",
      "and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\n",
      "which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude--\n",
      "\"May I ask if your engagement is of long standing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have been engaged these four years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four years!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I did not know,\" said she, \"that you were even\n",
      "acquainted till the other day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.\n",
      "He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your uncle!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk\n",
      "of Mr. Pratt?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I have,\" replied Elinor, with an exertion\n",
      "of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple,\n",
      "near Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun,\n",
      "for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,\n",
      "and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till\n",
      "a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost\n",
      "always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter\n",
      "into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and\n",
      "approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved\n",
      "him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--\n",
      "Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\n",
      "very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what\n",
      "she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added,\n",
      "with revived security of Edward's honour and love,\n",
      "and her companion's falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\n",
      "Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at\n",
      "what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon;\n",
      "but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.\n",
      "We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward\n",
      "Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street,\n",
      "and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
      "is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely\n",
      "to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\n",
      "depends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,\n",
      "\"that I should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.\n",
      "Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.--\n",
      "You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore,\n",
      "there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name\n",
      "to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his\n",
      "sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough\n",
      "for his not mentioning it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her\n",
      "self-command did not sink with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she\n",
      "with a firm voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have\n",
      "to wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\"\n",
      "Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added,\n",
      "\"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look\n",
      "at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,\n",
      "but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person\n",
      "it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor\n",
      "saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a\n",
      "too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood\n",
      "might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of\n",
      "its being Edward's face.  She returned it almost instantly,\n",
      "acknowledging the likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give\n",
      "him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at,\n",
      "for he has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am\n",
      "determined to set for it the very first opportunity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.\n",
      "They then proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world\n",
      "of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must\n",
      "know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach\n",
      "his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.\n",
      "I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\n",
      "proud woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor;\n",
      "\"but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I\n",
      "may be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;\n",
      "but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary\n",
      "a communication.  You must at least have felt that my\n",
      "being acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy,\n",
      "hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the\n",
      "falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying;\n",
      "but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great\n",
      "liberty with you,\" said she, \"in telling you all this.\n",
      "I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least,\n",
      "but I have known you and all your family by description\n",
      "a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if\n",
      "you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case,\n",
      "I really thought some explanation was due to you after my\n",
      "making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother;\n",
      "and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose\n",
      "advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that knows of it,\n",
      "and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great\n",
      "deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\n",
      "betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,\n",
      "as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest\n",
      "fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was\n",
      "mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.\n",
      "You can't think how much I go through in my mind from\n",
      "it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what\n",
      "I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.\n",
      "Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing\n",
      "him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.\n",
      "I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did\n",
      "not feel very compassionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,\n",
      "\"I think whether it would not be better for us both\n",
      "to break off the matter entirely.\"  As she said this,\n",
      "she looked directly at her companion.  \"But then\n",
      "at other times I have not resolution enough for it.--\n",
      "I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,\n",
      "as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.\n",
      "And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't\n",
      "think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise\n",
      "me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you\n",
      "do yourself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question;\n",
      "\"but I can give you no advice under such circumstances.\n",
      "Your own judgment must direct you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes\n",
      "silence on both sides, \"his mother must provide for him\n",
      "sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it!\n",
      "Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at\n",
      "Barton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,\n",
      "to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.\n",
      "Did you think he came directly from town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of\n",
      "every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity;\n",
      "\"I remember he told us, that he had been staying\n",
      "a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\"\n",
      "She remembered too, her own surprise at the time,\n",
      "at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends,\n",
      "at his total silence with respect even to their names.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\"\n",
      "repeated Lucy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you\n",
      "should suspect what was the matter; but it made him\n",
      "so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a\n",
      "fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--\n",
      "Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;\n",
      "for he writes in wretched spirits.  I heard from him just\n",
      "before I left Exeter;\" taking a letter from her pocket\n",
      "and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.\n",
      "\"You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;\n",
      "but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,\n",
      "I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\n",
      "as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt\n",
      "no longer.  This picture, she had allowed herself to believe,\n",
      "might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have\n",
      "been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them\n",
      "by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement,\n",
      "could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she\n",
      "was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she could\n",
      "hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary;\n",
      "and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\n",
      "of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for\n",

      "She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\n",

      "what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any\n",
      "sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him,\n",
      "and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her\n",
      "readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness\n",
      "in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested\n",
      "in it than as a friend, which she very much feared\n",
      "her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse,\n",
      "must have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed\n",
      "to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain\n",
      "that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise,\n",
      "not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing\n",
      "to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance,\n",
      "with a secret so confessedly and evidently important.\n",
      "And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had\n",
      "some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remained so well\n",
      "assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward,\n",
      "it required no other consideration of probabilities\n",
      "to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous;\n",
      "and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof.\n",
      "What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\n",
      "there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's\n",
      "superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him\n",
      "in future?  She had little difficulty in understanding thus\n",
      "much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly\n",
      "resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\n",
      "honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward\n",
      "and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\n",
      "herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy\n",
      "that her heart was unwounded.  And as she could now have\n",
      "nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\n",
      "been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going\n",
      "through a repetition of particulars with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not immediately that an opportunity\n",
      "of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well\n",
      "disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred;\n",
      "for the weather was not often fine enough to allow\n",
      "of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily\n",
      "separate themselves from the others; and though they\n",
      "met at least every other evening either at the park\n",
      "or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could\n",
      "not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation.\n",
      "Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady\n",
      "Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure\n",
      "was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for\n",
      "particular discourse.  They met for the sake of eating,\n",
      "drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\n",
      "or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One or two meetings of this kind had taken place,\n",
      "without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy\n",
      "in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,\n",
      "to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all\n",
      "dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged\n",
      "to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be\n",
      "quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.\n",
      "Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\n",
      "had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be,\n",
      "more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\n",
      "and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when\n",
      "her husband united them together in one noisy purpose,\n",
      "immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her\n",
      "mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne,\n",
      "though always unwilling to join any of their parties,\n",
      "was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\n",
      "seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily\n",
      "preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her.\n",
      "The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor\n",
      "had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought\n",
      "or expression, and nothing could be less interesting\n",
      "than the whole of their discourse both in the dining\n",
      "parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children\n",
      "accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was\n",
      "too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's\n",
      "attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the\n",
      "removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed,\n",
      "and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\n",
      "entertained a hope of finding time for conversation\n",
      "at the park.  They all rose up in preparation for a round game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad,\" said Lady Middleton to Lucy,\n",
      "\"you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's\n",
      "basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your\n",
      "eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make\n",
      "the dear little love some amends for her disappointment\n",
      "to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly\n",
      "and replied, \"Indeed you are very much mistaken,\n",
      "Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can\n",
      "make your party without me, or I should have been at my\n",
      "filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel\n",
      "for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now,\n",
      "I am resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--\n",
      "will you ring the bell for some working candles?\n",
      "My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know,\n",
      "if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I\n",
      "told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends\n",
      "upon having it done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy directly drew her work table near her\n",
      "and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\n",
      "which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\n",
      "delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.\n",
      "No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual\n",
      "inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed,\n",
      "\"Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you\n",
      "know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;\n",
      "I have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  And without\n",
      "farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven\n",
      "that SHE had never made so rude a speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument\n",
      "you know, ma'am,\" said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth\n",
      "away the offence; \"and I do not much wonder at it; for it\n",
      "is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining five were now to draw their cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen\n",
      "to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele,\n",
      "in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still\n",
      "to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible\n",
      "I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.\n",
      "I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow\n",
      "me a share in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you\n",
      "for your help,\" cried Lucy, \"for I find there is more\n",
      "to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would\n",
      "be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele--\n",
      "\"Dear little soul, how I do love her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor;\n",
      "\"and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be\n",
      "as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber,\n",
      "or will you take your chance now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals,\n",
      "and thus by a little of that address which Marianne\n",
      "could never condescend to practise, gained her own end,\n",
      "and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.  Lucy made room\n",
      "for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were\n",
      "thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\n",
      "utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.\n",
      "The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own\n",
      "music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten\n",
      "that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily\n",
      "so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely,\n",
      "under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\n",
      "subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have\n",
      "honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance,\n",
      "or no farther curiosity on its subject.  I will\n",
      "not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking\n",
      "the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was\n",
      "somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I\n",
      "told you that Monday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\"\n",
      "and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,\n",
      "\"nothing could be farther from my intention than to give\n",
      "you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for the trust,\n",
      "that was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet I do assure you,\" replied Lucy, her little\n",
      "sharp eyes full of meaning, \"there seemed to me to be\n",
      "a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\n",
      "quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was angry with me;\n",
      "and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\n",
      "took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.\n",
      "But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy,\n",
      "and that you really do not blame me.  If you knew what a\n",
      "consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\n",
      "of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life,\n",
      "your compassion would make you overlook every thing else\n",
      "I am sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great\n",
      "relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be\n",
      "assured that you shall never have reason to repent it.\n",
      "Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to\n",
      "be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need\n",
      "of all your mutual affection to support you under them.\n",
      "Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would\n",
      "be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part,\n",
      "I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh.\n",
      "I have been always used to a very small income, and could\n",
      "struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well\n",
      "to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that\n",
      "his mother might give him if he married to please her.\n",
      "We must wait, it may be for many years.  With almost every\n",
      "other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;\n",
      "but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\n",
      "I know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That conviction must be every thing to you;\n",

      "as between many people, and under many circumstances\n",

      "\"Edward's love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty\n",
      "well put to the test, by our long, very long absence\n",
      "since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial\n",
      "so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.\n",
      "I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's\n",

      "from his being so much more in the world than me, and our\n",
      "continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion,\n",
      "to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been\n",
      "the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,\n",
      "or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for,\n",
      "or if he had talked more of one lady than another,\n",
      "or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he\n",
      "used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly\n",

      "\"are your views? or have you none but that of waiting for\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking\n",
      "extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this,\n",
      "and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\n",
      "in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk\n",

      "which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\n",
      "friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me,\n",
      "your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;\n",
      "which I understand is a very good one, and the present\n",
      "incumbent not likely to live a great while.  That would\n",

      "had I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;\n",
      "the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\n",

      "she was not without a settled habitation of her own.\n",
      "Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success\n",
      "in a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every\n",
      "winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square.\n",
      "Towards this home, she began on the approach of January\n",
      "to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly,\n",
      "and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses\n",
      "Dashwood to accompany her.  Elinor, without observing\n",
      "the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look\n",
      "which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave\n",
      "a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she\n",
      "believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations.\n",
      "The reason alleged was their determined resolution\n",
      "of not leaving their mother at that time of the year.\n",

      "\"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you\n",

      "your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it.\n",
      "Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me,\n",
      "for I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you.\n",
      "It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I\n",
      "hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to go\n",
      "very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,\n",
      "if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good,\n",
      "you may always go with one of my daughters.  I am sure\n",

      "and if I don't get one of you at least well married\n",
      "before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault.\n",

      "\"I have a notion,\" said Sir John, \"that Miss Marianne\n",
      "would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister\n",
      "would come into it.  It is very hard indeed that she\n",
      "should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood\n",

      "\"Nay,\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure I shall be\n",
      "monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss\n",

      "to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.\n",
      "But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have.\n",
      "Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself,\n",
      "I who have been always used till this winter to have\n",
      "Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike\n",

      "Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood\n",

      "understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to\n",
      "almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\n",
      "to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\n",
      "opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her\n",
      "mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected\n",
      "to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit,\n",
      "which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which\n",
      "on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid.\n",
      "Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager\n",
      "to promote--she could not expect to influence the latter\n",

      "had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she\n",
      "dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination\n",
      "for going to London.  That Marianne, fastidious as she was,\n",
      "thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners,\n",
      "and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every\n",
      "inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever\n",
      "must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her\n",
      "pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong,\n",
      "so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor,\n",
      "in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "persuaded that such an excursion would be productive\n",
      "of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving\n",
      "through all her affectionate attention to herself,\n",
      "how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear\n",
      "of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on\n",
      "their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee,\n",

      "\"I am delighted with the plan,\" she cried,\n",
      "\"it is exactly what I could wish.  Margaret and I shall\n",

      "and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly\n",
      "and happily together with our books and our music! You\n",
      "will find Margaret so improved when you come back again!\n",
      "I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too,\n",
      "which may now be performed without any inconvenience\n",
      "to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to town;\n",
      "I would have every young woman of your condition in life\n",
      "acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.\n",
      "You will be under the care of a motherly good sort\n",

      "and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness\n",
      "of that kind with very little effort.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not help smiling at this display of\n",
      "indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she\n",
      "had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave\n",
      "with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself,\n",
      "that if her sister persisted in going, she would\n",
      "go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne\n",
      "should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment,\n",
      "or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\n",
      "of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours.\n",
      "To this determination she was the more easily reconciled,\n",
      "by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,\n",
      "was not to be in town before February; and that\n",
      "their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement,\n",
      "might be previously finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will have you BOTH go,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\n",
      "\"these objections are nonsensical.  You will have much\n",
      "pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together;\n",
      "and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,\n",
      "she would foresee it there from a variety of sources;\n",
      "she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\n",
      "acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the\n",
      "attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might\n",
      "be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now\n",
      "on this attack, though almost hopeless of success,\n",
      "she forced herself to begin her design by saying,\n",
      "as calmly as she could, \"I like Edward Ferrars very much,\n",
      "and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest\n",
      "of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference\n",
      "to me, whether I am ever known to them or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.\n",
      "Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor\n",
      "conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.\n",
      "\n",

      "deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;\n",

      "Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\n",
      "her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\n",

      "of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when\n",
      "she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan,\n",
      "and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner,\n",
      "restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more\n",

      "own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\n",
      "but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\n",

      "and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place.\n",
      "Should the result of her observations be unfavourable,\n",
      "she was determined at all events to open the eyes\n",

      "might be expected to be.  She sat in silence almost all\n",
      "the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever\n",
      "voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque\n",
      "beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\n",

      "talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her\n",
      "whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side\n",
      "treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous\n",
      "on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only\n",
      "disturbed that she could not make them choose their own\n",

      "of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up,\n",
      "and the young ladies were immediately put in possession\n",
      "of a very comfortable apartment.  It had formerly\n",

      "that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did the same.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am NOT going to write to my mother,\"\n",
      "replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid\n",
      "any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it immediately\n",

      "and the conclusion which as instantly followed was,\n",
      "that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\n",
      "the affair, they must be engaged.  This conviction,\n",
      "though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,\n",
      "and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n",
      "Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes;\n",
      "in length it could be no more than a note; it was then\n",
      "folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.\n",
      "Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in\n",
      "the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne,\n",
      "ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it\n",
      "to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post.\n",
      "This decided the matter at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her spirits still continued very high; but there\n",
      "was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\n",
      "pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as\n",
      "the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,\n",
      "and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room,\n",
      "seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\n",

      "It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "by being much engaged in her own room, could see little\n",
      "of what was passing.  The tea things were brought in,\n",
      "and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once\n",
      "by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\n",
      "heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house,\n",
      "Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,\n",
      "and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door.\n",
      "Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds;\n",
      "she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs,\n",
      "and after listening half a minute, returned into the room\n",
      "in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\n",
      "him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her\n",
      "feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming,\n",
      "\"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!\" and seemed\n",
      "almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel\n",
      "Brandon appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness,\n",
      "and she immediately left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too;\n",
      "but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured\n",
      "his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that\n",
      "a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\n",
      "experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.\n",
      "She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him,\n",
      "that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,\n",

      "\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor answered in some distress that she was,\n",

      "and of every thing to which she could decently attribute\n",
      "her sister's behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her with the most earnest attention,\n",
      "but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject,\n",
      "and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\n",
      "in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey,\n",
      "and the friends they had left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest\n",
      "on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out\n",
      "of spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere.\n",
      "Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were\n",
      "then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain\n",
      "by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way\n",
      "of saying something, she asked if he had been in London\n",
      "ever since she had seen him last.  \"Yes,\" he replied,\n",
      "with some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have been\n",
      "once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never\n",
      "been in my power to return to Barton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This, and the manner in which it was said,\n",

      "circumstances of his quitting that place, with the\n",
      "uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "and she was fearful that her question had implied\n",
      "much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she,\n",
      "with her usual noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad\n",
      "to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your\n",
      "pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little,\n",
      "and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I\n",
      "have been at home, and you know one has always a world\n",
      "of little odd things to do after one has been away for\n",
      "any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with--\n",
      "Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!\n",

      "\n",

      "to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel,\n",
      "I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is,\n",
      "you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere.\n",
      "Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be\n",
      "sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing\n",
      "to be young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I\n",
      "never was very handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got\n",
      "a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest\n",
      "beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has been dead\n",
      "these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have\n",
      "you been to since we parted?  And how does your business\n",
      "go on?  Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied with his accustomary mildness to all\n",
      "her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.\n",
      "Elinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was\n",
      "obliged to appear again.\n",

      "seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\n",
      "that day.  They had not long finished their breakfast before\n",
      "Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few\n",
      "minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted\n",
      "to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she\n",
      "received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss\n",
      "Dashwoods again.  So surprised at their coming to town,\n",
      "though it was what she had rather expected all along;\n",
      "so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation\n",
      "after having declined her own, though at the same time\n",
      "she would never have forgiven them if they had not come!\n",
      "\n",

      "said she; \"What do you think he said when he heard\n",

      "\n",
      "After an hour or two spent in what her mother called\n",
      "comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry\n",

      "Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could\n",
      "never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase,\n",
      "however it might equally concern them both: she received\n",
      "no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at\n",
      "home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation\n",
      "at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught\n",
      "by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild\n",
      "to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\n",

      "as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\n",

      "in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young,\n",

      "to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived\n",
      "more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\n",
      "other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time\n",
      "with much concern his continued regard for her sister.\n",
      "She feared it was a strengthening regard.  It grieved her\n",
      "to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne,\n",
      "and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a week after their arrival, it became\n",
      "certain that Willoughby was also arrived.  His card\n",
      "was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Marianne, \"he has been here while\n",
      "we were out.\"  Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his\n",
      "being in London, now ventured to say, \"Depend upon it,\n",
      "he will call again tomorrow.\"  But Marianne seemed\n",
      "hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,\n",
      "escaped with the precious card.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor,\n",
      "restored to those of her sister all, and more than all,\n",
      "their former agitation.  From this moment her mind was\n",
      "never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour\n",
      "of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted\n",
      "on being left behind, the next morning, when the others\n",
      "went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing\n",
      "in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's\n",
      "glance at her sister when they returned was enough to\n",
      "inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there.\n",
      "A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For me!\" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am, for my mistress.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are expecting a letter, then?\" said Elinor,\n",
      "unable to be longer silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, a little--not much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause.  \"You have no confidence\n",
      "in me, Marianne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have\n",
      "confidence in no one!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me!\" returned Elinor in some confusion; \"indeed,\n",
      "Marianne, I have nothing to tell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" answered Marianne with energy, \"our situations\n",
      "then are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;\n",
      "you, because you do not communicate, and I, because\n",
      "I conceal nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself,\n",
      "which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how,\n",
      "under such circumstances, to press for greater openness\n",
      "in Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being\n",
      "given her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,\n",
      "announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before,\n",
      "and requesting the company of her mother and cousins\n",
      "the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part,\n",
      "and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling\n",
      "in Berkeley Street.  The invitation was accepted;\n",
      "but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as\n",
      "it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they\n",
      "should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some\n",
      "difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still\n",
      "she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was\n",
      "not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling\n",
      "to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor found, when the evening was over,\n",
      "that disposition is not materially altered by a change\n",
      "of abode, for although scarcely settled in town,\n",
      "Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\n",
      "young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was\n",
      "an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.\n",
      "In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;\n",
      "but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more\n",
      "important and less easily attained, it was risking too much\n",
      "for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that\n",
      "Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple,\n",
      "with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former,\n",
      "whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town,\n",
      "as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\n",
      "to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her,\n",
      "they received no mark of recognition on their entrance.\n",
      "He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know\n",
      "who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from\n",
      "the other side of the room.  Marianne gave one glance\n",
      "round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE\n",
      "was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed\n",
      "to receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been\n",
      "assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards\n",
      "the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\n",
      "in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed\n",
      "of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\n",
      "something very droll on hearing that they were to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you were both in Devonshire,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you?\" replied Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When do you go back again?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know.\" And thus ended their discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance\n",
      "in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much\n",
      "fatigued by the exercise.  She complained of it\n",
      "as they returned to Berkeley Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"we know the reason\n",
      "of all that very well; if a certain person who shall\n",
      "be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a\n",
      "bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty\n",
      "of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Invited!\" cried Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir\n",
      "John met him somewhere in the street this morning.\"\n",
      "Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt.\n",
      "Impatient in this situation to be doing something\n",
      "that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved\n",
      "to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped\n",
      "by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,\n",
      "to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed;\n",
      "and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\n",
      "by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne\n",
      "was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose\n",
      "it to be to any other person.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by\n",
      "herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly,\n",
      "while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious\n",
      "for conversation, walked from one window to the other,\n",
      "or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\n",
      "Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother,\n",
      "relating all that had passed, her suspicions of\n",
      "Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea\n",
      "of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\n",
      "of her real situation with respect to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap\n",
      "foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced.\n",
      "Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated\n",
      "company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.\n",
      "He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\n",
      "satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he\n",
      "had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some\n",
      "time without saying a word.  Elinor, persuaded that he\n",
      "had some communication to make in which her sister\n",
      "was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.\n",
      "It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\n",
      "of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with\n",
      "the observation of \"your sister looks unwell to-day,\"\n",
      "or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\n",
      "on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,\n",
      "something particular about her.  After a pause of several\n",
      "minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her\n",
      "in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate\n",
      "her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not\n",
      "prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready,\n",
      "was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient,\n",
      "of asking what he meant?  He tried to smile as he replied,\n",
      "\"your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally\n",
      "known.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It cannot be generally known,\" returned Elinor,\n",
      "\"for her own family do not know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked surprised and said, \"I beg your pardon,\n",
      "I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not\n",
      "supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond,\n",
      "and their marriage is universally talked of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can that be? By whom can you have heard\n",
      "it mentioned?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others\n",
      "with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,\n",
      "and the Middletons.  But still I might not have believed it,\n",
      "for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\n",
      "be convinced, it will always find something to support\n",
      "its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\n",
      "accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.  I came to inquire,\n",
      "but I was convinced before I could ask the question.\n",
      "Is every thing finally settled?  Is it impossible to-?\n",
      "But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding.\n",
      "Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong\n",
      "in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on\n",
      "your prudence I have the strongest dependence.  Tell me\n",
      "that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt,\n",
      "that in short concealment, if concealment be possible,\n",
      "is all that remains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal\n",
      "of his love for her sister, affected her very much.\n",
      "She was not immediately able to say anything, and even\n",
      "when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short\n",
      "time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.\n",
      "The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister\n",
      "was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring\n",
      "to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much\n",
      "as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's\n",
      "affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection\n",
      "might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\n",
      "from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind,\n",
      "after some consideration, to say more than she really knew\n",
      "or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though\n",
      "she had never been informed by themselves of the terms\n",
      "on which they stood with each other, of their mutual\n",
      "affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence\n",
      "she was not astonished to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened to her with silent attention, and on\n",
      "her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,\n",
      "and after saying in a voice of emotion, \"to your sister\n",
      "I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\n",
      "may endeavour to deserve her,\"--took leave, and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\n",
      "conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\n",
      "other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a\n",
      "melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness,\n",
      "and was prevented even from wishing it removed,\n",
      "by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Nothing occurred during the next three or four days,\n",
      "to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying\n",
      "to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote.\n",
      "They were engaged about the end of that time to attend\n",
      "Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was\n",
      "kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter;\n",
      "and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,\n",
      "careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent\n",
      "whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look\n",
      "of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the\n",
      "drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady\n",
      "Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat,\n",
      "or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts,\n",
      "and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at\n",
      "last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them\n",
      "at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that\n",
      "any one was expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived in due time at the place of destination,\n",
      "and as soon as the string of carriages before them\n",
      "would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their\n",
      "names announced from one landing-place to another in an\n",
      "audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up,\n",
      "quite full of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had\n",
      "paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady\n",
      "of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd,\n",
      "and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to\n",
      "which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some time\n",
      "spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat\n",
      "down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for\n",
      "moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs,\n",
      "placed themselves at no great distance from the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor\n",
      "perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards\n",
      "of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable\n",
      "looking young woman.  She soon caught his eye, and he\n",
      "immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,\n",
      "or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;\n",
      "and then continued his discourse with the same lady.\n",
      "Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether\n",
      "it could be unobserved by her.  At that moment she first\n",
      "perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with\n",
      "sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,\n",
      "had not her sister caught hold of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, \"he is there--he\n",
      "is there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot\n",
      "I speak to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray, pray be composed,\" cried Elinor, \"and do\n",
      "not betray what you feel to every body present.\n",
      "Perhaps he has not observed you yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This however was more than she could believe herself;\n",
      "and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond\n",
      "the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish.  She sat\n",
      "in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he turned round again, and regarded them both;\n",
      "she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone\n",
      "of affection, held out her hand to him.  He approached,\n",
      "and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne,\n",
      "as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to\n",
      "observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town.\n",
      "Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address,\n",
      "and was unable to say a word.  But the feelings of her sister\n",
      "were instantly expressed.  Her face was crimsoned over,\n",
      "and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,\n",
      "\"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?\n",
      "Have you not received my letters?  Will you not shake\n",
      "hands with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed\n",
      "painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.\n",
      "During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.\n",
      "Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression\n",
      "becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spoke\n",
      "with calmness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley\n",
      "Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was\n",
      "not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But have you not received my notes?\" cried Marianne\n",
      "in the wildest anxiety.  \"Here is some mistake I am\n",
      "sure--some dreadful mistake.  What can be the meaning\n",
      "of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me,\n",
      "what is the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his\n",
      "embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye\n",
      "of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,\n",
      "he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered\n",
      "himself again, and after saying, \"Yes, I had the pleasure\n",
      "of receiving the information of your arrival in town,\n",
      "which you were so good as to send me,\" turned hastily away\n",
      "with a slight bow and joined his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable\n",
      "to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every\n",
      "moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the\n",
      "observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to him, Elinor,\" she cried, as soon as she\n",
      "could speak, \"and force him to come to me.  Tell him\n",
      "I must see him again--must speak to him instantly.--\n",
      "I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till this\n",
      "is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--\n",
      "Oh go to him this moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne,\n",
      "you must wait.  This is not the place for explanations.\n",
      "Wait only till tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With difficulty however could she prevent her\n",
      "from following him herself; and to persuade her to check\n",
      "her agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance\n",
      "of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy\n",
      "and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued\n",
      "incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery\n",
      "of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness.\n",
      "In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the\n",
      "door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he\n",
      "was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again\n",
      "that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.\n",
      "She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady\n",
      "Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable\n",
      "to stay a minute longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber,\n",
      "on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too\n",
      "polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away,\n",
      "and making over her cards to a friend, they departed\n",
      "as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word\n",
      "was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.\n",
      "Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even\n",
      "for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,\n",
      "they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn\n",
      "restored her a little to herself.  She was soon undressed\n",
      "and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,\n",
      "her sister then left her, and while she waited the return\n",
      "of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over\n",
      "the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "That some kind of engagement had subsisted\n",
      "between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt,\n",

      "for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes,\n",
      "SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake\n",
      "or misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough\n",
      "change of sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation\n",
      "would have been still stronger than it was, had she\n",

      "Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day,\n",
      "or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning\n",
      "in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling\n",
      "against one of the window-seats for the sake of all\n",
      "the little light she could command from it, and writing\n",
      "as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.\n",
      "In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation\n",
      "and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her\n",
      "for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone\n",
      "of the most considerate gentleness,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne, may I ask-?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Elinor,\" she replied, \"ask nothing; you will\n",
      "soon know all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said,\n",
      "lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately\n",
      "followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.\n",
      "It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,\n",
      "and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,\n",
      "at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her\n",
      "feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing\n",
      "for the last time to Willoughby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention\n",
      "in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and\n",
      "tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her,\n",
      "with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability,\n",
      "not to speak to her for the world.  In such circumstances,\n",
      "it was better for both that they should not be long together;\n",
      "and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented\n",
      "her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed,\n",
      "but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place,\n",
      "made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding\n",
      "the sight of every body.\n",
      "\n",
      "At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat\n",
      "any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed,\n",
      "not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing\n",
      "to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning's\n",
      "notice entirely to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting\n",
      "themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a\n",
      "letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught\n",
      "from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness,\n",
      "instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly\n",
      "by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must\n",
      "come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness\n",
      "at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,\n",
      "and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it\n",
      "impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning's notice.  That good lady,\n",
      "however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter\n",
      "from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,\n",
      "and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,\n",
      "that she would find it to her liking.  Of Elinor's distress,\n",
      "she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted\n",
      "for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing\n",
      "her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so\n",
      "desperately in love in my life!  MY girls were nothing\n",
      "to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as\n",
      "for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.\n",
      "I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her\n",
      "waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her\n",
      "look so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when are they to be married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at\n",
      "that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack\n",
      "as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, \"And have\n",
      "you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion\n",
      "of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I thought\n",
      "it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems\n",
      "to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not\n",
      "deceive yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing\n",
      "would surprise me more than to hear of their being going\n",
      "to be married.\"\n",

      "the first moment they met?  Did not I see them together\n",
      "in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I\n",
      "know that your sister came to town with me on purpose\n",
      "to buy wedding clothes?  Come, come, this won't do.\n",
      "Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody\n",
      "else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you,\n",
      "for it has been known all over town this ever so long.\n",
      "I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, Ma'am,\" said Elinor, very seriously,\n",
      "\"you are mistaken.  Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing\n",
      "in spreading the report, and you will find that you have\n",
      "though you will not believe me now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not\n",
      "spirits to say more, and eager at all events to know\n",
      "what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room,\n",
      "where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on\n",
      "the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\n",
      "and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near,\n",
      "but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,\n",
      "took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,\n",
      "and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first\n",
      "was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter,\n",
      "though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness\n",
      "of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in\n",
      "joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands;\n",
      "and then covering her face with her handkerchief,\n",
      "almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,\n",
      "shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course,\n",
      "watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\n",
      "spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter,\n",

      "all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used\n",
      "a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I\n",
      "wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.\n",
      "And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it.\n",
      "I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever\n",
      "I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he\n",
      "has not had this many a day.  But there is one comfort,\n",
      "my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man\n",
      "in the world worth having; and with your pretty face\n",
      "you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won't\n",
      "disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry\n",
      "out at once and have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons\n",
      "luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room,\n",
      "as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could\n",
      "be increased by noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne, to the surprise of her sister,\n",
      "determined on dining with them.  Elinor even advised\n",
      "her against it.  But \"no, she would go down; she could\n",
      "bear it very well, and the bustle about her would\n",
      "be less.\"  Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a\n",
      "moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly\n",
      "possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more;\n",
      "and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\n",
      "while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready\n",

      "When there, though looking most wretchedly,\n",

      "Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions\n",
      "to her, this calmness could not have been maintained;\n",
      "but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction\n",
      "of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing\n",
      "that was passing before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness,\n",
      "though its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes\n",
      "almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments,\n",
      "and returned her those civilities, which her sister could\n",
      "not make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw\n",
      "that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing\n",
      "was due to her which might make her at all less so.\n",
      "She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness\n",
      "of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\n",
      "its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,\n",
      "was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house,\n",
      "and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.\n",
      "Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,\n",
      "seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained\n",
      "by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love,\n",
      "by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire.\n",
      "As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was\n",
      "forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could\n",
      "stay no longer.  With a hasty exclamation of Misery,\n",
      "and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got\n",
      "up and hurried out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor soul!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone,\n",
      "\"how it grieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is\n",

      "cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.\n",
      "I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would\n",
      "send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest\n",
      "thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl\n",
      "so ill!  But when there is plenty of money on one side,\n",

      "her? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome.\n",

      "a very wealthy man.  But the family are all rich together.\n",
      "Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won't come\n",
      "before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.\n",
      "No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!\n",
      "Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man,\n",
      "be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl,\n",
      "and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off\n",
      "from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer\n",
      "girl is ready to have him.  Why don't he, in such a case,\n",
      "sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants,\n",
      "and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you,\n",
      "Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters\n",
      "came round.  But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the\n",

      "made!--What now,\" after pausing a moment--\"your poor sister\n",
      "is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself.\n",
      "Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,\n",
      "it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we\n",
      "shall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.\n",
      "What shall we play at?  She hates whist I know; but is there\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name\n",

      "been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two,\n",
      "for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as\n",
      "long as that.  And so the letter that came today finished it!\n",
      "Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,\n",
      "I would not have joked her about it for all my money.\n",
      "But then you know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made\n",
      "sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and\n",
      "you know young people like to be laughed at about them.  Lord!\n",
      "how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they\n",
      "hear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have called\n",
      "in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.\n",
      "But I shall see them tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are\n",

      "\n",
      "\"In this affair it can only do harm; more so\n",
      "perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it\n",

      "Two thousand a year without debt or drawback--except\n",
      "the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;\n",
      "but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then\n",

      "in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner!\n",

      "were there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful\n",
      "stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing,\n",
      "in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is\n",
      "close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from\n",
      "the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only\n",
      "go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house,\n",
      "you may see all the carriages that pass along.\n",
      "Oh! 'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the village,\n",

      "in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired,\n",

      "\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected\n",
      "that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the\n",
      "house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it\n",
      "for your sister.  My poor husband! how fond he was of it!\n",
      "Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said\n",
      "it did him more good than any thing else in the world.\n",
      "Do take it to your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Ma'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference\n",
      "of the complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good\n",
      "you are!  But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope,\n",
      "almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much\n",
      "service to her as rest, if you will give me leave,\n",
      "I will drink the wine myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been\n",
      "five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise;\n",
      "and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected,\n",
      "that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present,\n",
      "of little importance to her, its healing powers,\n",
      "on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\n",
      "on herself as on her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea,\n",
      "and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne,\n",
      "Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\n",
      "nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\n",
      "was already aware of what occasioned her absence.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought;\n",
      "for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room\n",
      "to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--\n",
      "\"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows\n",
      "nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's,\n",
      "and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his\n",
      "good information, inquired after her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"She has been\n",
      "indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I\n",
      "heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it\n",
      "than I could believe possible at first.\"\n",

      "\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short,\n",
      "that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I\n",
      "tell you?  If you know it already, as surely you must,\n",
      "I may be spared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness,\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO\n",
      "know it all.  This seems to have been a day of general\n",
      "elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us.\n",
      "Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I\n",
      "had business.  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage,\n",
      "and one of them was giving the other an account of the\n",
      "intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,\n",
      "that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name\n",
      "of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated,\n",
      "first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive\n",
      "assertion that every thing was now finally settled\n",
      "respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer\n",
      "to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,\n",
      "with many particulars of preparations and other matters.\n",
      "One thing, especially, I remember, because it served\n",
      "to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony\n",
      "was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat\n",
      "in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would be\n",
      "impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative\n",
      "lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop\n",
      "till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I\n",
      "have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey\n",
      "has fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,\n",
      "we may find an explanation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least\n",
      "I think\"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice\n",
      "which seemed to distrust itself, \"And your sister--\n",
      "how did she--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have\n",
      "only to hope that they may be proportionately short.\n",
      "It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  Till yesterday,\n",
      "I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now,\n",
      "perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was\n",
      "really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and,\n",
      "in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Colonel Brandon, \"there is, indeed!  But\n",

      "of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties,\n",
      "the subject was necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had\n",

      "in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side,\n",

      "\n",
      "From a night of more sleep than she had expected,\n",
      "Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\n",
      "of misery in which she had closed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\n",
      "of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had\n",
      "gone through the subject again and again; and with the same\n",
      "steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,\n",
      "the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\n",
      "Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe\n",
      "Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,\n",
      "and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility\n",
      "of acquitting him.  At one moment she was absolutely\n",
      "indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another\n",
      "she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\n",
      "could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however,\n",
      "she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding,\n",
      "where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it.\n",
      "Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried;\n",
      "\"she cannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;\n",
      "her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants\n",
      "is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\n",
      "to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others,\n",
      "by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too\n",
      "great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\n",
      "strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.\n",
      "Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there\n",
      "be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent\n",
      "abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither\n",
      "reasonable nor candid.  She expected from other people\n",
      "the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged\n",
      "of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\n",
      "on herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the\n",
      "sisters were together in their own room after breakfast,\n",
      "which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower\n",
      "in her estimation; because, through her own weakness,\n",
      "it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself,\n",
      "though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse\n",
      "of the utmost goodwill.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance\n",
      "gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,\n",
      "she entered their room, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure\n",
      "will do you good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination\n",
      "placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness\n",
      "and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,\n",
      "convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,\n",
      "rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet,\n",
      "by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter.\n",
      "The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.\n",
      "The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome,\n",
      "was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment\n",
      "which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope,\n",
      "she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within\n",
      "her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,\n",
      "could have expressed; and now she could reproach her\n",
      "only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\n",
      "passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely\n",
      "lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,\n",
      "she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.\n",
      "But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it,\n",
      "brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.\n",
      "Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying\n",
      "as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused\n",
      "by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater\n",
      "openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness\n",
      "towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such\n",
      "a conviction of their future happiness in each other,\n",
      "that she wept with agony through the whole of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "All her impatience to be at home again now returned;\n",
      "her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through\n",
      "the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby,\n",
      "and she was wildly urgent to be gone.  Elinor, unable herself\n",
      "to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be\n",
      "in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own\n",
      "except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;\n",
      "and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait\n",
      "for that knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she\n",
      "could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able\n",
      "to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing\n",
      "Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest\n",
      "of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of\n",
      "the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving,\n",
      "by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying\n",
      "any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother\n",
      "an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions\n",
      "for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room\n",
      "on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table\n",
      "where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen,\n",
      "grieving over her for the hardship of such a task,\n",
      "and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this manner they had continued about a quarter\n",
      "of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then\n",
      "bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who can this be?\" cried Elinor.  \"So early too! I\n",
      "thought we HAD been safe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne moved to the window--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is Colonel Brandon!\" said she, with vexation.\n",
      "\"We are never safe from HIM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will not trust to THAT,\" retreating to her own room.\n",
      "\"A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no\n",
      "conscience in his intrusion on that of others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The event proved her conjecture right, though it\n",
      "was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon\n",
      "DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that\n",
      "solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw\n",
      "THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look,\n",
      "and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her,\n",
      "could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,\" said he,\n",
      "after the first salutation, \"and she encouraged me\n",
      "to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged,\n",
      "because I thought it probable that I might find you alone,\n",
      "which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my\n",
      "wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe\n",
      "it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must\n",
      "not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction,\n",
      "lasting conviction to your sister's mind.  My regard for her,\n",
      "for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it,\n",
      "by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY\n",
      "sincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being\n",
      "useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours\n",
      "have been spent in convincing myself that I am right,\n",
      "is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?\"\n",
      "He stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" said Elinor.  \"You have something\n",
      "to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character\n",
      "farther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship\n",
      "that can be shewn Marianne.  MY gratitude will be insured\n",
      "immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS\n",
      "must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton\n",
      "last October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go\n",
      "farther back.  You will find me a very awkward narrator,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A short\n",
      "account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it\n",
      "SHALL be a short one.  On such a subject,\" sighing heavily,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--\n",
      "(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression\n",
      "on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton\n",
      "Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded\n",
      "to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure,\n",
      "your sister Marianne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" answered Elinor, \"I have NOT forgotten it.\"\n",
      "He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality\n",
      "of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance\n",
      "between them, as well in mind as person.  The same warmth\n",
      "of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits.\n",
      "This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from\n",
      "her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.\n",
      "Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years\n",
      "we were playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the\n",
      "time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her,\n",
      "as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my\n",
      "present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me\n",
      "incapable of having ever felt.  Her's, for me, was, I believe,\n",
      "fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby\n",
      "and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.\n",
      "At seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was\n",
      "married--married against her inclination to my brother.\n",
      "Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\n",
      "And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the\n",
      "conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.\n",
      "My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.\n",
      "I had hoped that her regard for me would support her\n",
      "under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at\n",
      "last the misery of her situation, for she experienced\n",
      "great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\n",
      "she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I\n",
      "relate!  I have never told you how this was brought on.\n",
      "We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland.\n",
      "The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.\n",
      "I was banished to the house of a relation far distant,\n",
      "and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\n",
      "till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her\n",
      "fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--\n",
      "but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was,\n",
      "a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least\n",
      "I should not have now to lament it.  This however\n",
      "was not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;\n",
      "his pleasures were not what they ought to have been,\n",
      "and from the first he treated her unkindly.  The consequence\n",
      "of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced\n",
      "as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resigned\n",
      "herself at first to all the misery of her situation;\n",
      "and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\n",
      "regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we\n",
      "wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy,\n",
      "and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for\n",
      "my father lived only a few months after their marriage,\n",
      "and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\n",
      "should fall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I\n",
      "meant to promote the happiness of both by removing\n",
      "from her for years, and for that purpose had procured\n",
      "my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\n",
      "he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of\n",
      "trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard,\n",
      "about two years afterwards, of her divorce.  It was\n",
      "THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection\n",
      "of what I suffered--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few\n",
      "minutes about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,\n",
      "and still more by his distress, could not speak.  He saw\n",
      "her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it,\n",
      "and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few minutes more\n",
      "of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was nearly three years after this unhappy\n",
      "period before I returned to England.  My first care,\n",
      "when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her;\n",
      "but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.\n",
      "I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there\n",
      "was every reason to fear that she had removed from him\n",
      "only to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance\n",
      "was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her\n",
      "comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that\n",
      "the power of receiving it had been made over some months\n",
      "before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he\n",
      "imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,\n",
      "had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief.\n",
      "At last, however, and after I had been six months in England,\n",
      "I DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my own,\n",
      "who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit\n",
      "him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt;\n",
      "and there, the same house, under a similar confinement,\n",
      "was my unfortunate sister.  So altered--so faded--worn\n",
      "down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I\n",
      "believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me,\n",
      "to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\n",
      "on whom I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding\n",
      "her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\n",
      "to describe it--I have pained you too much already.\n",
      "That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage\n",

      "my greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her,\n",
      "beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;\n",
      "and that was given.  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings,\n",

      "Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched\n",
      "for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!\n",

      "brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which\n",
      "left to me the possession of the family property,) she\n",
      "visited me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;\n",

      "of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now three\n",
      "years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,)\n",
      "that I removed her from school, to place her under the care\n",
      "of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,\n",
      "who had the charge of four or five other girls of about\n",
      "the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason\n",
      "to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,\n",
      "almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.\n",
      "I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned\n",
      "out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of\n",
      "her young friends, who was attending her father there\n",
      "for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,\n",
      "and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,\n",
      "for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy,\n",
      "she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she\n",
      "certainly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,\n",
      "but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,\n",
      "give no information; for he had been generally confined\n",
      "to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town\n",
      "and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried\n",
      "to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,\n",
      "of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business.\n",
      "In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;\n",

      "on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell;\n",
      "and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\n",
      "which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange\n",
      "to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some.\n",
      "Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his\n",
      "looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party,\n",
      "that I was called away to the relief of one whom he\n",

      "gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,\n",

      "youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of\n",
      "the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,\n",
      "no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had left her,\n",

      "your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured\n",
      "that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\n",
      "for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and\n",

      "so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do?\n",
      "I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes\n",
      "I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him.\n",

      "however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL\n",
      "turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she\n",
      "compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers\n",
      "the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl,\n",

      "still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented\n",
      "by self-reproach, which must attend her through life.\n",
      "Surely this comparison must have its use with her.\n",
      "She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They\n",
      "proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.\n",
      "On the contrary, every friend must be made still more\n",
      "her friend by them.  Concern for her unhappiness,\n",
      "and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\n",
      "every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,\n",
      "in communicating to her what I have told you.  You must\n",
      "know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously,\n",
      "and from my heart believed it might be of service,\n",
      "might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered\n",
      "myself to trouble you with this account of my family\n",

      "When the particulars of this conversation were repeated\n",
      "by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were,\n",
      "the effect on her was not entirely such as the former\n",
      "had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne appeared to distrust\n",
      "the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all\n",
      "with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\n",
      "objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby,\n",
      "and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to\n",
      "be impossible.  But though this behaviour assured Elinor\n",
      "that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to\n",
      "her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it,\n",
      "in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,\n",
      "in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,\n",
      "with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she\n",
      "saw her spirits less violently irritated than before,\n",
      "she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did become\n",
      "settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.\n",
      "She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily\n",
      "than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and\n",
      "desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl,\n",
      "and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been\n",
      "on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\n",
      "that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\n",
      "even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence,\n",
      "gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\n",
      "by the most open and most frequent confession of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only\n",
      "to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt\n",
      "and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than\n",
      "Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.\n",
      "Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\n",
      "arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought;\n",
      "to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat\n",
      "she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.\n",
      "Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be,\n",
      "when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying\n",
      "and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets,\n",
      "which SHE could wish her not to indulge!\n",
      "\n",
      "Against the interest of her own individual comfort,\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for\n",
      "Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton,\n",
      "where every thing within her view would be bringing back\n",
      "the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner,\n",
      "by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as\n",
      "she had always seen him there.  She recommended it to\n",
      "her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their\n",
      "visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never\n",
      "exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least\n",
      "five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects,\n",
      "and of company, which could not be procured at Barton,\n",
      "would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped,\n",
      "cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself,\n",
      "and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both\n",
      "might now be spurned by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "From all danger of seeing Willoughby again,\n",
      "her mother considered her to be at least equally safe\n",
      "in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must\n",
      "now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.\n",
      "Design could never bring them in each other's way:\n",
      "negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise;\n",

      "force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham\n",
      "on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at\n",
      "first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect\n",
      "as a certain one.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had yet another reason for wishing her children\n",
      "to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law\n",
      "had told her that he and his wife were to be in town\n",
      "before the middle of February, and she judged it right\n",
      "that they should sometimes see their brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion,\n",
      "and she submitted to it therefore without opposition,\n",
      "though it proved perfectly different from what she wished\n",
      "and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong,\n",
      "formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her\n",
      "longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\n",
      "possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal\n",
      "sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and\n",
      "such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a matter of great consolation to her,\n",
      "that what brought evil to herself would bring good to\n",
      "her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that\n",
      "it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely,\n",
      "comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer\n",
      "stay would therefore militate against her own happiness,\n",
      "it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return\n",
      "into Devonshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever\n",

      "Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended\n",
      "towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was\n",

      "for all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side\n",
      "of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two\n",

      "painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present\n",

      "Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings\n",

      "of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner\n",
      "in deciding on all the different horrors of the different\n",
      "toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining\n",
      "unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect\n",

      "an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too;\n",
      "\"but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really\n",
      "she had no leisure for going any where.\"  Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "however, assured him directly, that she should not stand\n",
      "upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something\n",
      "like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her.\n",
      "His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind;\n",
      "to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel\n",

      "him to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.\n",
      "\n",
      "After staying with them half an hour, he asked\n",
      "Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce\n",
      "him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.  The weather was\n",
      "remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Me, brother! what do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am\n",
      "convinced of it.  What is the amount of his fortune?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe about two thousand a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two thousand a-year;\" and then working himself\n",
      "up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added,\n",
      "\"Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much,\n",
      "for your sake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I believe you,\" replied Elinor; \"but I am\n",
      "very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish\n",
      "of marrying ME.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.\n",
      "A very little trouble on your side secures him.\n",
      "Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness\n",
      "of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends\n",
      "may all advise him against it.  But some of those little\n",
      "attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\n",
      "give will fix him, in spite of himself.  And there can be\n",
      "no reason why you should not try for him.  It is not to be\n",
      "supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short,\n",
      "you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\n",
      "out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--\n",
      "you have too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon\n",
      "must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on\n",
      "my part to make him pleased with you and your family.\n",
      "It is a match that must give universal satisfaction.\n",
      "In short, it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his voice\n",
      "to an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome\n",
      "to ALL PARTIES.\" Recollecting himself, however, he added,\n",
      "\"That is, I mean to say--your friends are all truly\n",
      "anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly,\n",
      "for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.\n",
      "And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman,\n",
      "I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much\n",
      "the other day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued,\n",
      "\"something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I\n",
      "a sister settling at the same time.  And yet it is not\n",
      "very unlikely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution,\n",
      "\"going to be married?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is not actually settled, but there is such\n",
      "a thing in agitation.  He has a most excellent mother.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward,\n",
      "and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\n",
      "takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\n",
      "of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.\n",
      "A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not\n",
      "a doubt of its taking place in time.  A thousand a-year\n",
      "is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over\n",
      "for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give\n",
      "you another instance of her liberality:--The other day,\n",
      "as soon as we came to town, aware that money could\n",
      "not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes\n",
      "into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.\n",
      "And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\n",
      "expense while we are here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused for her assent and compassion; and she\n",
      "forced herself to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly\n",
      "be considerable; but your income is a large one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.\n",
      "I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly\n",
      "a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better.\n",
      "The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,\n",
      "is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little\n",
      "purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm,\n",
      "you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.\n",
      "The land was so very desirable for me in every respect,\n",
      "so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it\n",
      "my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my\n",
      "conscience to let it fall into any other hands.  A man must\n",
      "pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal\n",
      "of money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again,\n",
      "the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the\n",
      "purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed;\n",
      "for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not\n",
      "happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands,\n",
      "I must have sold out to very great loss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could only smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have\n",
      "had on first coming to Norland.  Our respected father,\n",
      "as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects\n",
      "that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\n",
      "to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his\n",
      "doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\n",
      "own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,\n",
      "we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen,\n",
      "china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.\n",
      "You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we\n",
      "must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's\n",
      "kindness is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality,\n",
      "I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\"\n",
      "he gravely replied; \"but however there is still a great\n",
      "deal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny's\n",
      "green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden\n",
      "marked out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old\n",
      "walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.\n",
      "It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park,\n",
      "and the flower-garden will slope down just before it,\n",
      "and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old\n",
      "thorns that grew in patches over the brow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself;\n",
      "and was very thankful that Marianne was not present,\n",
      "to share the provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now said enough to make his poverty clear,\n",
      "and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings\n",
      "for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's\n",
      "his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to\n",
      "congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house,\n",
      "her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income;\n",
      "and it is an acquaintance that has not only been\n",
      "of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove\n",
      "materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is\n",
      "certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it\n",
      "speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all\n",
      "probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--\n",
      "She must have a great deal to leave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has\n",
      "only her jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\n",
      "her income.  Few people of common prudence will do THAT;\n",
      "and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of.\"\n",

      "The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John\n",
      "Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit\n",
      "the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing\n",
      "more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address,\n",
      "who met her husband's sisters without any affection,\n",
      "and almost without having anything to say to them;\n",
      "for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street,\n",
      "she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did\n",
      "not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town;\n",
      "but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily\n",
      "to mention his name before her, till able to tell her\n",
      "that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on,\n",
      "or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon\n",

      "much attached to each other, that they could not be too\n",
      "sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.\n",
      "The intelligence however, which SHE would not give,\n",
      "soon flowed from another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly\n",
      "to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward,\n",
      "though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
      "He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear\n",
      "of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet,\n",

      "within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.\n",
      "Twice was his card found on the table, when they returned\n",
      "from their morning's engagements.  Elinor was pleased\n",

      "a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began,\n",
      "invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had\n",
      "taken a very good house for three months.  Their sisters\n",
      "and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood\n",
      "was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad\n",
      "to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\n",
      "civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.\n",
      "They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn\n",
      "whether her sons were to be of the party.  The expectation\n",
      "of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested\n",
      "in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's\n",
      "mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\n",
      "to attend such an introduction, though she could now see\n",
      "her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself,\n",
      "her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interest with which she thus anticipated the\n",
      "party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully\n",

      "were also to be at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton,\n",
      "so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,\n",
      "that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her\n",
      "sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John\n",
      "to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street;\n",
      "and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss\n",

      "however, towards procuring them seats at her table;\n",
      "but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,\n",
      "who had long wanted to be personally known to the family,\n",
      "to have a nearer view of their characters and her own\n",
      "difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\n",

      "\n",
      "On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began\n",
      "immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with\n",
      "his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party\n",
      "given by his sister; and to see him for the first time,\n",
      "after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly\n",
      "knew how she could bear it!\n",
      "\n",
      "These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded\n",
      "entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.\n",
      "They were relieved however, not by her own recollection,\n",
      "but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be\n",
      "inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\n",
      "that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,\n",
      "and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\n",
      "by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\n",
      "affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they\n",
      "were together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important Tuesday came that was to introduce\n",
      "the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!\" said Lucy, as they\n",
      "walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived\n",
      "so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed\n",
      "the servant at the same time--\"There is nobody here but\n",
      "you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.\n",

      "my happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could have given her immediate relief\n",
      "by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother,\n",
      "rather than her own, whom they were about to behold;\n",
      "but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with\n",
      "great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter\n",
      "amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself,\n",
      "hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright,\n",
      "even to formality, in her figure, and serious,\n",
      "even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her complexion was sallow;\n",
      "and her features small, without beauty, and naturally\n",
      "without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow\n",
      "had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity,\n",
      "by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature.\n",
      "She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people\n",
      "in general, she proportioned them to the number of\n",
      "her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her,\n",
      "not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed\n",
      "with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.--\n",
      "A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it\n",
      "was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;--\n",
      "and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles,\n",
      "a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more,\n",
      "only amused her.  She could not but smile to see the graciousness\n",
      "of both mother and daughter towards the very person--\n",
      "for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,\n",
      "had they known as much as she did, they would have been most\n",
      "anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively\n",
      "no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both.\n",
      "But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied,\n",
      "she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from\n",
      "which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions\n",
      "with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance,\n",
      "without thoroughly despising them all four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably\n",
      "distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed\n",
      "about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous,\n",
      "and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination\n",
      "for show, and the Master's ability to support it.\n",
      "In spite of the improvements and additions which were\n",
      "making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner\n",
      "having once been within some thousand pounds of being\n",
      "obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom\n",
      "of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--\n",
      "no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--\n",
      "but there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood\n",
      "had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,\n",
      "and his wife had still less.  But there was no peculiar\n",
      "disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with\n",
      "the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured\n",
      "under one or other of these disqualifications for being\n",
      "agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want\n",
      "of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room\n",
      "after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident,\n",
      "for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some\n",
      "variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land,\n",
      "and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one\n",
      "subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in,\n",
      "which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,\n",
      "and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were nearly\n",
      "of the same age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had both the children been there, the affair might\n",
      "have been determined too easily by measuring them at once;\n",
      "but as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural\n",
      "assertion on both sides; and every body had a right to\n",
      "be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it\n",
      "over and over again as often as they liked.\n",

      "The parties stood thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "The two mothers, though each really convinced that\n",

      "of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two grandmothers, with not less partiality,\n",
      "but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support\n",
      "of their own descendant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent\n",
      "than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall\n",
      "for their age, and could not conceive that there could\n",
      "be the smallest difference in the world between them;\n",
      "and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it,\n",
      "as fast as she could, in favour of each.\n",

      "Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on\n",
      "William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and\n",

      "it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called\n",
      "on for her's, offended them all, by declaring that she\n",
      "had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted\n",
      "a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law,\n",

      "ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,\n",
      "catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following\n",

      "handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are done by my eldest sister,\" said he; \"and you,\n",

      "\n",
      "The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions\n",
      "to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he\n",
      "would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood;\n",
      "and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited,\n",
      "they were handed round for general inspection.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work,\n",
      "particularly requested to look at them; and after they had\n",
      "received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation,\n",
      "Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing\n",
      "her, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hum\"--said Mrs. Ferrars--\"very pretty,\"--and without\n",
      "regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother\n",
      "had been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little,\n",
      "she immediately said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?\" But then again,\n",
      "the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself,\n",
      "probably came over her, for she presently added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not think they are something in Miss\n",
      "Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.\"\n",

      "praise of another, at Elinor's expense, though she\n",
      "had not any notion of what was principally meant by it,\n",
      "provoked her immediately to say with warmth,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is admiration of a very particular kind!--\n",
      "what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, or who cares,\n",
      "for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so saying, she took the screens out of her\n",
      "sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they\n",
      "ought to be admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing\n",

      "this bitter philippic, \"Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was\n",
      "all in a fright at his sister's audacity.  Elinor was\n",
      "much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been\n",
      "by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they\n",
      "were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only\n",

      "seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses\n",
      "to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think\n",
      "of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\n",
      "affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment,\n",
      "to her sister's chair, and putting one arm round her neck,\n",

      "into tears.  Every body's attention was called, and almost\n",
      "every body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went\n",
      "to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "with a very intelligent \"Ah! poor dear,\" immediately gave\n",

      "to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy,\n",
      "and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\n",
      "improved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy,\n",
      "nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself,\n",
      "to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him,\n",
      "and that she had very much regretted being from home,\n",
      "when he called before in Berkeley Street.  She would\n",
      "not be frightened from paying him those attentions which,\n",
      "as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the\n",

      "Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he\n",

      "exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case\n",
      "rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare;\n",

      "several minutes on the landing-place, with the most\n",
      "high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister.\n",
      "When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures\n",
      "of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into\n",
      "the drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him\n",
      "was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself,\n",
      "and strongly spoken.  She met him with a hand that would\n",
      "be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear Edward!\" she cried, \"this is a moment of great\n",
      "happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,\n",
      "but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\n",

      "or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the\n",
      "most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes\n",
      "at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each\n",
      "other should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.\n",
      "Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice\n",
      "Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her\n",
      "not finding London agree with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't think of me!\" she replied with spirited\n",
      "earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears\n",
      "as she spoke, \"don't think of MY health.  Elinor is well,\n",
      "you see.  That must be enough for us both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This remark was not calculated to make Edward or\n",
      "Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy,\n",
      "who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you like London?\" said Edward, willing to say\n",
      "any thing that might introduce another subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it,\n",
      "but I have found none.  The sight of you, Edward, is the\n",
      "only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you\n",
      "are what you always were!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused--no one spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think, Elinor,\" she presently added, \"we must\n",
      "employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton.\n",
      "In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust,\n",
      "Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was,\n",
      "nobody knew, not even himself.  But Marianne, who saw\n",
      "his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever\n",
      "cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,\n",
      "and soon talked of something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street\n",
      "yesterday!  So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much\n",
      "to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this admirable discretion did she defer\n",
      "the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\n",
      "disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly\n",
      "disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends\n",
      "were to be met?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, Miss Marianne,\" cried Lucy, eager to take\n",
      "some revenge on her, \"you think young men never stand\n",
      "upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them,\n",
      "little as well as great.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely\n",
      "insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very\n",
      "sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.\n",
      "And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience\n",
      "in the world; the most scrupulous in performing\n",
      "every engagement, however minute, and however it\n",
      "may make against his interest or pleasure.  He is the\n",
      "most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,\n",
      "and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body\n",
      "I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.\n",
      "What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you\n",
      "must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept\n",
      "of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of her commendation, in the present case,\n",
      "however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the\n",
      "feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very\n",
      "unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going so soon!\" said Marianne; \"my dear Edward,\n",
      "this must not be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And drawing him a little aside, she whispered\n",
      "her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer.\n",
      "But even this encouragement failed, for he would go;\n",
      "and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\n",
      "two hours, soon afterwards went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can bring her here so often?\" said Marianne,\n",
      "on her leaving them.  \"Could not she see that we wanted\n",
      "her gone!--how teazing to Edward!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been\n",
      "the longest known to him of any.  It is but natural\n",
      "that he should like to see her as well as ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, \"You know,\n",
      "Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.\n",
      "If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted,\n",

      "on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect\n",
      "was produced, but a look of indifference from the former,\n",
      "or of disgust in the latter.  An effort even yet lighter\n",
      "might have made her their friend.  Would they only have\n",

      "that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole\n",

      "was not exactly like every other baby of the same age;\n",
      "nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\n",
      "proposition of its being the finest child in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "I come now to the relation of a misfortune,\n",
      "which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood.\n",
      "It so happened that while her two sisters with\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street,\n",
      "another of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance\n",
      "in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her.\n",
      "But while the imaginations of other people will carry\n",
      "them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct,\n",
      "and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness\n",
      "must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.\n",
      "In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed\n",
      "her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability,\n",
      "that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods,\n",
      "and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters,\n",
      "she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street;\n",
      "and this misconstruction produced within a day\n",
      "or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them\n",
      "as well as for their brother and sister, to a small\n",
      "musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was,\n",
      "that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only\n",
      "to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\n",
      "carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse,\n",
      "must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\n",
      "to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they\n",
      "might not expect to go out with her a second time?  The power\n",
      "of disappointing them, it was true, must always be her's.\n",
      "But that was not enough; for when people are determined\n",
      "on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel\n",
      "injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much\n",
      "into the habit of going out every day, that it was become\n",
      "a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not:\n",
      "and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\n",
      "evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest\n",
      "amusement from any, and very often without knowing,\n",
      "till the last moment, where it was to take her.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\n",
      "indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,\n",
      "during the whole of her toilet, which it received from\n",
      "Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being\n",
      "together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute\n",
      "observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing,\n",
      "and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price\n",
      "of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the\n",
      "number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\n",
      "Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out\n",
      "before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,\n",
      "and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\n",
      "The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,\n",
      "was generally concluded with a compliment, which\n",
      "though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne\n",
      "as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing\n",
      "an examination into the value and make of her gown,\n",
      "the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair,\n",
      "she was almost sure of being told that upon \"her word\n",
      "she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would\n",
      "make a great many conquests.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed\n",
      "on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;\n",
      "which they were ready to enter five minutes after it\n",
      "stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable\n",
      "to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house\n",
      "of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay\n",
      "on their part that might inconvenience either herself\n",
      "or her coachman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The events of this evening were not very remarkable.\n",
      "The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a\n",
      "great many people who had real taste for the performance,\n",
      "and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers\n",
      "themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\n",
      "and that of their immediate friends, the first private\n",
      "performers in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,\n",
      "she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\n",
      "pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even\n",
      "by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix\n",
      "them at pleasure on any other object in the room.  In one\n",
      "of these excursive glances she perceived among a group\n",
      "of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture\n",
      "on toothpick-cases at Gray's.  She perceived him soon\n",
      "afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly\n",
      "to her brother; and had just determined to find out his\n",
      "name from the latter, when they both came towards her,\n",
      "and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.\n",
      "\n",
      "He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted\n",
      "his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\n",
      "words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb\n",
      "she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had\n",
      "it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended\n",
      "less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest\n",
      "relations!  For then his brother's bow must have given\n",
      "the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother\n",
      "and sister would have begun.  But while she wondered\n",
      "at the difference of the two young men, she did not find\n",
      "that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out\n",
      "of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other.\n",
      "Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself\n",
      "in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation;\n",
      "for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\n",
      "GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing\n",
      "in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it\n",
      "much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune\n",
      "of a private education; while he himself, though probably\n",
      "without any particular, any material superiority\n",
      "by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\n",
      "was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my soul,\" he added, \"I believe it is nothing more;\n",
      "and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving\n",
      "about it.  'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must\n",
      "make yourself easy.  The evil is now irremediable,\n",
      "and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would\n",
      "you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your\n",
      "own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,\n",
      "at the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent\n",
      "him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending\n",
      "him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'\n",
      "This is the way in which I always consider the matter,\n",
      "and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because,\n",
      "whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\n",
      "of a public school, she could not think of Edward's\n",
      "abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You reside in Devonshire, I think,\"--was his\n",
      "next observation, \"in a cottage near Dawlish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor set him right as to its situation;\n",
      "and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\n",
      "could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish.\n",
      "He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\n",
      "species of house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For my own part,\" said he, \"I am excessively fond\n",
      "of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much\n",
      "elegance about them.  And I protest, if I had any money\n",
      "to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself,\n",
      "within a short distance of London, where I might drive\n",
      "myself down at any time, and collect a few friends\n",
      "about me, and be happy.  I advise every body who is going\n",
      "to build, to build a cottage.  My friend Lord Courtland\n",
      "came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\n",
      "and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.\n",
      "I was to decide on the best of them.  'My dear Courtland,'\n",
      "said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not\n",
      "adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.'\n",
      "And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations,\n",
      "no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake.\n",
      "I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.\n",
      "Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  'But how can it\n",
      "be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it\n",
      "is to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage\n",
      "that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?'\n",
      "I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it,\n",
      "so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.\n",
      "The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\n",
      "card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library\n",
      "may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the\n",
      "supper be set out in the saloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted\n",
      "with the thought.  We measured the dining-room, and found\n",
      "it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair\n",
      "was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact,\n",
      "you see, if people do but know how to set about it,\n",
      "every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\n",
      "as in the most spacious dwelling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think\n",
      "he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\n",
      "eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\n",
      "any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening,\n",
      "which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,\n",
      "when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's\n",
      "mistake,\n",
      "in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the\n",
      "propriety of their being really invited to become such,\n",
      "while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept her from home.\n",
      "The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more;\n",
      "and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\n",
      "of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\n",
      "complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father.\n",
      "Fanny was startled at the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not see how it can be done,\" said she,\n",
      "\"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day\n",
      "with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it.\n",
      "You know I am always ready to pay them any attention\n",
      "in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.\n",
      "But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them\n",
      "away from her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband, but with great humility, did not see\n",
      "the force of her objection.  \"They had already spent a week\n",
      "in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton\n",
      "could not be displeased at their giving the same number\n",
      "of days to such near relations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it\n",
      "was in my power.  But I had just settled within myself\n",
      "to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us.\n",
      "They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think\n",
      "the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very\n",
      "well by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year,\n",
      "you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.\n",
      "I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them,\n",
      "you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they\n",
      "are such favourites with Harry!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity\n",
      "of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience\n",
      "was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters\n",
      "another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting\n",
      "that another year would make the invitation needless,\n",
      "by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife,\n",
      "and Marianne as THEIR visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready\n",
      "wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,\n",
      "to request her company and her sister's, for some days,\n",
      "in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.\n",
      "This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself;\n",
      "cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!\n",
      "Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was,\n",
      "above all things, the most material to her interest,\n",
      "and such an invitation the most gratifying to her\n",
      "feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be too\n",
      "gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;\n",
      "and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had\n",
      "any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been\n",
      "always meant to end in two days' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten\n",
      "minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time,\n",
      "some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark\n",
      "of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance,\n",
      "seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose\n",
      "from something more than merely malice against herself;\n",
      "and might be brought, by time and address, to do\n",
      "every thing that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already\n",
      "subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry\n",
      "into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these\n",
      "were effects that laid open the probability of greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all\n",
      "that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened\n",
      "her expectation of the event.  Sir John, who called on\n",
      "them more than once, brought home such accounts of the\n",
      "favour they were in, as must be universally striking.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any\n",

      "visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period\n",

      "About the third or fourth morning after their\n",
      "being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,\n",
      "entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting\n",
      "by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance\n",
      "as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her\n",
      "time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am.  What is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.--\n",
      "When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite\n",
      "in a fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very\n",
      "ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\n",
      "So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'\n",
      "says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum--'\n",
      "and nurse said just the same.  But Charlotte, she would\n",
      "not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily\n",
      "he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\n",
      "stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child,\n",
      "be said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world\n",
      "but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy.  And so,\n",
      "just as he was going away again, it came into my head,\n",
      "I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it,\n",
      "but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.\n",
      "So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,\n",
      "and seemed to know something or other, and at last he\n",
      "said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report\n",
      "should reach the young ladies under your care as to their\n",
      "sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say,\n",
      "that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  'Lord!' says I,\n",
      "'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the\n",
      "long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn,\n",
      "seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young\n",
      "man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\n",
      "turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing\n",
      "in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged\n",
      "above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you,\n",
      "my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter,\n",
      "except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?--\n",
      "There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\n",
      "but that matters should be brought so forward between them,\n",
      "and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened\n",
      "to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it\n",
      "out directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,\n",
      "for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\n",
      "brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--\n",
      "till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a\n",
      "well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.\n",
      "'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond\n",
      "of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'\n",
      "and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all\n",
      "alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to\n",
      "come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five\n",
      "minutes before, that she thought to make a match between\n",
      "Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who.\n",
      "So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\n",
      "and pride.  She fell into violent hysterics immediately,\n",
      "with such screams as reached your brother's ears,\n",
      "as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,\n",
      "thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country.\n",
      "So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place,\n",
      "for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming\n",
      "what was going on.  Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,\n",
      "I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded\n",
      "like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit.\n",
      "Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;\n",
      "and your brother, he walked about the room, and said\n",
      "he did not know what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared\n",
      "they should not stay a minute longer in the house,\n",
      "and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,\n",
      "to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\n",
      "up their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again,\n",
      "and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,\n",
      "and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar.\n",
      "The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\n",
      "cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he\n",
      "came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says,\n",
      "she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad.\n",
      "I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\n",
      "with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her.\n",
      "Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he\n",
      "hears of it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for\n",
      "they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may.\n",
      "I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\n",
      "passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I\n",
      "had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,\n",
      "that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may\n",
      "be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she\n",
      "was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,\n",
      "for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;\n",
      "and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for\n",
      "either of them.  I have no notion of people's making\n",
      "such a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no\n",
      "reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry;\n",
      "for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well\n",
      "by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,\n",
      "she knows better than any body how to make the most\n",
      "of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\n",
      "allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good\n",
      "an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.\n",
      "Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage\n",
      "as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men;\n",
      "and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my\n",
      "Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them\n",
      "exactly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had\n",
      "time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able\n",
      "to give such an answer, and make such observations,\n",
      "as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\n",
      "Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\n",
      "interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late\n",
      "often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her\n",
      "at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest,\n",
      "in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able\n",
      "to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to\n",
      "give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality\n",
      "on the conduct of every one concerned in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could hardly determine what her own expectation\n",
      "of its event really was; though she earnestly tried\n",
      "to drive away the notion of its being possible to end\n",
      "otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy.\n",
      "What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could\n",
      "not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear;\n",
      "and still more anxious to know how Edward would\n",
      "conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much compassion;--\n",
      "for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure\n",
      "that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject,\n",
      "Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for\n",
      "its discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiving her,\n",
      "in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in\n",
      "endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\n",
      "without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,\n",
      "or any resentment against Edward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going\n",
      "to remove what she really believed to be her sister's\n",
      "chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she\n",
      "feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and\n",
      "to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\n",
      "which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own\n",
      "disappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such a task\n",
      "must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore\n",
      "hastened to perform it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\n",
      "feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much,\n",
      "any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised\n",
      "since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might\n",
      "suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\n",
      "Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could\n",
      "not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied\n",
      "by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged\n",
      "rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror,\n",
      "and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter\n",
      "of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs;\n",
      "and all the comfort that could be given by assurances\n",
      "of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest\n",
      "vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence,\n",
      "was readily offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.\n",
      "Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging\n",
      "as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely,\n",
      "could she feel less than herself!  As for Lucy Steele,\n",
      "she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\n",
      "incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could\n",
      "not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards\n",
      "to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her.\n",
      "She would not even admit it to have been natural;\n",
      "and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so,\n",
      "by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge\n",
      "of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her first communication had reached no farther than\n",
      "to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time\n",
      "it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,\n",
      "and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some\n",
      "time all that could be done was to soothe her distress,\n",
      "lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first\n",
      "question on her side, which led to farther particulars,\n",
      "was,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has\n",
      "he written to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy\n",
      "first came to Barton Park last November, she told me\n",
      "in confidence of her engagement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment\n",
      "which her lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder,\n",
      "she exclaimed--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor confirmed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this\n",
      "been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being\n",
      "happy!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not fit that you should then know how much\n",
      "I was the reverse!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four months!\"--cried Marianne again.--\"So calm!--\n",
      "so cheerful!--how have you been supported?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to\n",
      "Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore,\n",
      "to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my\n",
      "family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me,\n",
      "which it could not be in my power to satisfy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne seemed much struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\n",
      "mother,\" added Elinor; \"and once or twice I have attempted it;--\n",
      "but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort\n",
      "of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing\n",
      "how much I felt.  Now, I can think and speak of it with\n",
      "little emotion.  I would not have you suffer on my account;\n",
      "for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.\n",
      "I have many things to support me.  I am not conscious of having\n",
      "provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own,\n",
      "I have borne it as much as possible without spreading\n",
      "it farther.  I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.\n",
      "I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always\n",
      "doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret,\n",
      "in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,\n",
      "and that is the foundation on which every thing good may\n",
      "be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is\n",
      "bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,\n",
      "and all that can be said of one's happiness depending\n",
      "entirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it\n",
      "is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--\n",
      "Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior\n",
      "in person and understanding to half her sex; and time\n",
      "and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\n",
      "another superior to HER.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne,\n",
      "\"if the loss of what is most valued is so easily\n",
      "to be made up by something else, your resolution,\n",
      "your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\n",
      "wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever\n",
      "felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this\n",
      "hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak\n",
      "of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make\n",
      "you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\n",
      "to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.--\n",
      "It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the\n",
      "very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all\n",
      "my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.--\n",
      "This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose,\n",
      "by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\n",
      "deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have\n",
      "had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.--\n",
      "I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever,\n",
      "without hearing one circumstance that could make me less\n",
      "desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;\n",
      "nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--\n",
      "I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister,\n",
      "and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the\n",
      "punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.--\n",
      "And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you\n",
      "know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.--\n",
      "If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you\n",
      "may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure\n",
      "of mind with which I have brought myself at present\n",
      "to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been\n",
      "willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and\n",
      "painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--\n",
      "they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.--\n",
      "No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,\n",
      "perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I\n",
      "owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was\n",
      "VERY unhappy.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was quite subdued.--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate\n",
      "myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--\n",
      "you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me\n",
      "in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering\n",
      "for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I\n",
      "can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself,\n",
      "I have been trying to do it away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The tenderest caresses followed this confession.\n",
      "In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had\n",
      "no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\n",
      "she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\n",
      "never to speak of the affair to any one with the least\n",
      "appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying\n",
      "the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see\n",
      "Edward himself, if chance should bring them together,\n",
      "without any diminution of her usual cordiality.--\n",
      "These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt\n",
      "that she had injured, no reparation could be too much\n",
      "for her to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "She performed her promise of being discreet,\n",
      "to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion,\n",
      "dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three\n",
      "times to say, \"Yes, ma'am.\"--She listened to her praise\n",
      "of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another,\n",
      "and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection,\n",
      "it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances\n",
      "towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal\n",
      "to any thing herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning brought a farther trial of it,\n",
      "in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious\n",
      "aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them\n",
      "news of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity,\n",
      "as soon as he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery\n",
      "that took place under our roof yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful\n",
      "a moment for speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such\n",
      "complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may\n",
      "be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome.\n",
      "Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.\n",
      "But I would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there\n",
      "is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution\n",
      "is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing.\n",
      "She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!\n",
      "She says she never shall think well of anybody again;\n",
      "and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--\n",
      "meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness\n",
      "had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!  It\n",
      "was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she\n",
      "had asked these young women to her house; merely because\n",
      "she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,\n",
      "well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions;\n",
      "for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\n",
      "and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there,\n",
      "was attending her daughter.  And now to be so rewarded!\n",
      "'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her\n",
      "affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead\n",
      "of them.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done,\n",
      "he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny\n",
      "broke it to her, is not to be described.  While she with\n",
      "the truest affection had been planning a most eligible\n",
      "connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could\n",
      "be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such\n",
      "a suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she\n",
      "suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be\n",
      "in THAT quarter.  'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might\n",
      "have thought myself safe.' She was quite in an agony.\n",
      "We consulted together, however, as to what should be done,\n",
      "and at last she determined to send for Edward.\n",
      "He came.  But I am sorry to relate what ensued.\n",
      "All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end\n",
      "to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\n",
      "by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of\n",
      "no avail.  Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.\n",
      "I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before.\n",
      "His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case\n",
      "of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on\n",
      "him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings\n",
      "in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters\n",
      "grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition\n",
      "to this, if he still persisted in this low connection,\n",
      "represented to him the certain penury that must attend\n",
      "the match.  His own two thousand pounds she protested\n",
      "should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far\n",
      "would she be from affording him the smallest assistance,\n",
      "that if he were to enter into any profession with a view\n",
      "of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent\n",
      "him advancing in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,\n",
      "clapped her hands together, and cried, \"Gracious God!\n",
      "can this be possible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother,\n",
      "\"at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these.\n",
      "Your exclamation is very natural.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered\n",
      "her promises, and forbore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.\n",
      "Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in\n",
      "the most determined manner.  Nothing should prevail on\n",
      "him to give up his engagement.  He would stand to it,\n",
      "cost him what it might.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,\n",
      "no longer able to be silent, \"he has acted like an honest\n",
      "man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had\n",
      "done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal.\n",
      "I have some little concern in the business, as well\n",
      "as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe\n",
      "there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one\n",
      "who more deserves a good husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature\n",
      "was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished\n",
      "to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune.\n",
      "He therefore replied, without any resentment,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\n",
      "relation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,\n",
      "a very deserving young woman, but in the present case\n",
      "you know, the connection must be impossible.\n",
      "And to have entered into a secret engagement with a\n",
      "young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman\n",
      "especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,\n",
      "is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,\n",
      "I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\n",
      "whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish\n",
      "her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout\n",
      "the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother,\n",
      "in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has been dignified\n",
      "and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear\n",
      "it will be a bad one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;\n",
      "and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward,\n",
      "while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could\n",
      "not reward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:--\n",
      "Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.\n",
      "He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether\n",
      "he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can\n",
      "make no inquiry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.\n",
      "Born to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive\n",
      "a situation more deplorable.  The interest of two thousand\n",
      "pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added\n",
      "the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly,\n",
      "within three months have been in the receipt of two\n",
      "thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has\n",
      "thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself\n",
      "a more wretched condition.  We must all feel for him;\n",
      "and the more so, because it is totally out of our power\n",
      "to assist him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure\n",
      "he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house;\n",
      "and so I would tell him if I could see him.  It is not fit\n",
      "that he should be living about at his own charge now,\n",
      "at lodgings and taverns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward,\n",

      "by him, he might now have been in his proper situation,\n",
      "and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it is, it must\n",
      "be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is one\n",
      "thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than\n",
      "all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind\n",
      "of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately,\n",
      "which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions.\n",

      "\n",
      "A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion,\n",
      "concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his\n",
      "sisters that he really believed there was no material\n",
      "danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need\n",
      "not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\n",
      "leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\n",
      "on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's\n",
      "conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its\n",
      "true merit.  THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt\n",
      "him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,\n",
      "beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could\n",
      "remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune.\n",
      "Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all\n",
      "his offences in compassion for his punishment.  But though\n",
      "confidence between them was, by this public discovery,\n",
      "restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on\n",
      "which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.\n",
      "Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still\n",
      "more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive\n",
      "assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued\n",
      "affection for herself which she rather wished to do away;\n",
      "and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying\n",
      "to converse upon a topic which always left her more\n",
      "dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison\n",
      "it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt all the force of that comparison; but not\n",
      "as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now;\n",
      "she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach,\n",
      "regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\n",
      "herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\n",
      "without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened\n",
      "that she still fancied present exertion impossible,\n",
      "and therefore it only dispirited her more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,\n",
      "of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.\n",
      "But though so much of the matter was known to them already,\n",
      "that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\n",
      "that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,\n",
      "she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\n",
      "and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could;\n",
      "and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,\n",
      "had prevented her going to them within that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third day succeeding their knowledge of the\n",
      "particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw\n",
      "many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second\n",
      "week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number;\n",
      "but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again\n",
      "in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them,\n",
      "chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public\n",
      "a place.\n",
      "\n",
      "An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined\n",
      "them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was\n",
      "not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging\n",
      "all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left\n",
      "to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\n",
      "nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody\n",
      "who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting\n",
      "to her.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,\n",
      "accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy,\n",
      "expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving\n",
      "encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "left her own party for a short time, to join their's.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you\n",
      "any thing if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity\n",
      "and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT\n",
      "being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad to meet you;\" said Miss Steele,\n",
      "taking her familiarly by the arm--\"for I wanted to see you\n",
      "of all things in the world.\"  And then lowering her voice,\n",
      "\"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it.\n",
      "Is she angry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all, I believe, with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot suppose it possible that she should.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have\n",
      "had such a time of it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage\n",
      "in my life.  She vowed at first she would never trim me\n",
      "up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again,\n",
      "so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to,\n",
      "and we are as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me\n",
      "this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night.\n",
      "There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too.  But why\n",
      "should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS\n",
      "the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part,\n",
      "I should never have known he DID like it better than\n",
      "any other colour, if he had not happened to say so.\n",
      "My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare sometimes\n",
      "I do not know which way to look before them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor\n",
      "had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient\n",
      "to find her way back again to the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, but Miss Dashwood,\" speaking triumphantly,\n",
      "\"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's\n",
      "declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing\n",
      "I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured\n",
      "reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think\n",
      "about it herself, you know, it was no business of other\n",
      "people to set it down for certain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before,\n",
      "I assure you,\" said Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well,\n",
      "and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks,\n",
      "that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand\n",
      "pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had\n",
      "nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.\n",
      "And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself,\n",
      "that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars\n",
      "would be off; and when Edward did not come near us\n",
      "for three days, I could not tell what to think myself;\n",
      "and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost;\n",
      "for we came away from your brother's Wednesday,\n",
      "and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,\n",
      "and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.\n",
      "Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits\n",
      "rose against that.  However this morning he came just\n",
      "as we came home from church; and then it all came out,\n",
      "how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\n",
      "and been talked to by his mother and all of them,\n",
      "and how he had declared before them all that he loved\n",
      "nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have.\n",
      "And how he had been so worried by what passed,\n",
      "that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,\n",
      "he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country,\n",
      "some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn\n",
      "all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better\n",
      "of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again,\n",
      "he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,\n",
      "and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep\n",
      "her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss,\n",
      "for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope\n",
      "of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders,\n",
      "as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy,\n",
      "and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear\n",
      "to think of her doing no better, and so he begged,\n",
      "if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the\n",
      "matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.\n",
      "I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be.\n",
      "And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account,\n",
      "that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own.\n",
      "I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\n",
      "tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any\n",
      "thing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give\n",
      "ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly\n",
      "(with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,\n",
      "and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things\n",
      "you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least\n",
      "mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him\n",
      "upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have,\n",
      "she should be very glad to have it all, you know,\n",
      "or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,\n",
      "and talked on some time about what they should do,\n",
      "and they agreed he should take orders directly,\n",
      "and they must wait to be married till he got a living.\n",
      "And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\n",
      "called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in\n",
      "her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;\n",
      "so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them,\n",
      "to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not\n",
      "care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put\n",
      "on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\"\n",
      "said Elinor; \"you were all in the same room together,\n",
      "were not you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you\n",
      "think people make love when any body else is by?  Oh,\n",
      "for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that.\n",
      "(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the\n",
      "drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening\n",
      "at the door.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How!\" cried Elinor; \"have you been repeating to me\n",
      "what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?\n",
      "I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly\n",
      "would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a\n",
      "conversation which you ought not to have known yourself.\n",
      "How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at\n",
      "the door, and heard what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would\n",
      "have done just the same by me; for a year or two back,\n",
      "when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together,\n",
      "she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind\n",
      "a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss\n",
      "Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,\n",
      "from what was uppermost in her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,\" said she;\n",
      "\"but now he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an\n",
      "ill-natured woman his mother is, an't she? And your\n",
      "brother and sister were not very kind! However,\n",
      "I shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure\n",
      "they did send us home in their own chariot, which\n",
      "was more than I looked for.  And for my part, I was all\n",
      "in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the\n",
      "huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,\n",
      "nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine\n",
      "out of sight.  Edward have got some business at Oxford,\n",
      "he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,\n",
      "as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained.\n",
      "I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!\n",
      "(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what\n",
      "my cousins will say, when they hear of it.  They will\n",
      "tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward\n",
      "the curacy of his new living.  I know they will; but I am\n",
      "sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.--\n",
      "'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think\n",
      "of such a thing?  I write to the Doctor, indeed!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Elinor, \"it is a comfort to be prepared\n",
      "against the worst.  You have got your answer ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject,\n",
      "but the approach of her own party made another more necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal\n",
      "more to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not\n",
      "any longer.  I assure you they are very genteel people.\n",
      "He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their\n",
      "own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about\n",
      "it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she\n",
      "is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same;\n",
      "and if anything should happen to take you and your\n",
      "sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company,\n",
      "I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her\n",
      "for as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton\n",

      "you was not afraid of its being torn.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson;\n",
      "and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which\n",
      "might feed her powers of reflection some time, though she\n",
      "had learnt very little more than what had been already\n",
      "foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind.  Edward's marriage\n",
      "with Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time\n",
      "of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain,\n",
      "as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,\n",
      "exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment,\n",
      "of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they returned to the carriage,\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor\n",
      "wished to spread as little as possible intelligence\n",
      "that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained,\n",
      "she confined herself to the brief repetition of such\n",
      "simple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy,\n",
      "for the sake of her own consequence, would choose\n",
      "to have known.  The continuance of their engagement,\n",
      "and the means that were able to be taken for promoting\n",
      "its end, was all her communication; and this produced\n",
      "from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how\n",
      "THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding\n",
      "no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty\n",
      "pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds,\n",
      "and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can\n",
      "give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and\n",

      "The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than\n",
      "two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone\n",
      "increased every day.  She sighed for the air, the liberty,\n",
      "the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place\n",
      "could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly\n",
      "less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much\n",
      "less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she\n",
      "was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,\n",
      "which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.\n",
      "She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards\n",
      "its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes\n",
      "to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the\n",
      "eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,\n",
      "which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\n",
      "longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible\n",
      "than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland\n",
      "about the end of March, for the Easter holidays;\n",
      "and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very\n",
      "warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them.  This would\n",
      "not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of\n",
      "Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real\n",
      "politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very\n",
      "great amendment of his manners towards them since her\n",
      "sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept\n",
      "it with pleasure.\n",

      "\"No, I cannot go to Cleveland.\"--\n",

      "\n",
      "Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\n",
      "such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by\n",
      "working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure\n",
      "which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother,\n",
      "whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible,\n",
      "more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,\n",
      "and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,\n",
      "which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to\n",
      "Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey;\n",
      "and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend\n",
      "them down; and as there could be no occasion of their\n",
      "staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at\n",
      "home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's\n",

      "with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest,\n",

      "but it could not alter her design; and their mother's\n",
      "concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative\n",
      "to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--\n",

      "and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think\n",
      "her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window\n",
      "to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print,\n",
      "which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed\n",
      "her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed\n",
      "with her there for several minutes.  The effect of his\n",
      "discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation,\n",
      "for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\n",
      "changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear,\n",
      "to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne\n",
      "was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing\n",
      "that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation,\n",
      "and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--\n",
      "Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval\n",
      "of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another,\n",
      "some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear,\n",
      "in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\n",
      "of his house.  This set the matter beyond a doubt.\n",
      "She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary\n",
      "to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.\n",
      "What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish,\n",
      "but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did\n",
      "not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "commended her in her heart for being so honest.\n",
      "They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\n",

      "\n",
      "Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech,\n",

      "to this silent ejaculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not\n",
      "seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least,\n",
      "for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards,\n",
      "and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard\n",
      "Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.--\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing--what\n",
      "she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr. Ferrars two\n",
      "or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased\n",
      "with him.  He is not a young man with whom one can\n",
      "be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have\n",
      "seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake,\n",
      "and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.\n",
      "I understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you\n",
      "be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford,\n",
      "now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post,\n",
      "is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,\n",
      "perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now,\n",
      "it may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it\n",
      "were more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one;\n",
      "the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than\n",
      "200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable\n",
      "of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as\n",
      "to afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,\n",
      "however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,\n",
      "will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.\"\n",

      "Elinor's astonishment at this commission could\n",
      "hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really\n",
      "making her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,\n",
      "which only two days before she had considered as hopeless\n",
      "for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--\n",
      "and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to\n",
      "bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had\n",
      "attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor\n",

      "which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act,\n",
      "were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him\n",
      "for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and\n",
      "disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve;\n",
      "and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,\n",
      "if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\n",
      "to another.  But at the same time, she could not help\n",
      "thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.\n",
      "It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\n",
      "Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER,\n",
      "she would have been very glad to be spared herself;--\n",
      "but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy,\n",
      "declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being\n",
      "given through her means, that she would not on any account\n",
      "make farther opposition.  Edward, she believed, was still in\n",
      "town,\n",
      "and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.\n",
      "She could undertake therefore to inform him of it,\n",
      "in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,\n",
      "Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage\n",
      "in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour,\n",
      "and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the\n",
      "house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor,\n",

      "at least as far as regarded its size.\n",
      "\n",

      "By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE\n",
      "was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain\n",
      "consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it\n",
      "possible that Delaford living could supply such an income,\n",
      "as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on--\n",
      "and he said so.\n",

      "comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.\n",
      "I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;\n",
      "and my interest is hardly more extensive.  If, however,\n",
      "by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve\n",

      "from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful\n",
      "to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present.\n",

      "and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\n",
      "with it; which, with the consciousness of what she\n",
      "had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,\n",
      "made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.\n",
      "He too was much distressed; and they sat down together\n",
      "in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he\n",
      "had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\n",
      "into the room, he could not recollect; but determining\n",
      "to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form\n",
      "as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished\n",
      "to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I\n",
      "certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner;\n",
      "though at the same time, I should have been extremely\n",
      "sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\n",
      "especially as it will most likely be some time--it\n",
      "is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure\n",
      "of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor,\n",
      "recovering herself, and determined to get over what she\n",
      "so much dreaded as soon as possible, \"without receiving\n",
      "our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them\n",
      "in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said.\n",
      "I have something of consequence to inform you of,\n",
      "which I was on the point of communicating by paper.\n",
      "I am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing\n",
      "rather faster than usual as she spoke.)  Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say,\n",
      "that understanding you mean to take orders, he has\n",
      "great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford\n",
      "now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable.\n",
      "Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\n",
      "and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that\n",
      "the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much\n",
      "more considerable, and such as might better enable you\n",
      "to--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to\n",
      "yourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views\n",
      "of happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself,\n",
      "it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him.\n",
      "He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected,\n",
      "such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting;\n",
      "but he said only these two words,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution,\n",
      "as some of the worst was over, \"Colonel Brandon means\n",
      "it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\n",
      "passed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\n",
      "conduct of your family has placed you--a concern\n",
      "which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,\n",
      "must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\n",
      "for your general character, and his particular approbation\n",
      "of your behaviour on the present occasion.\"\n",

      "\"No,\" replied be, with sudden consciousness, \"not to\n",
      "find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you,\n",
      "to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express\n",
      "it if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you\n",
      "that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely,\n",
      "to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment\n",
      "of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,\n",
      "till I understood his design, that the living was vacant;\n",
      "nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\n",
      "had such a living in his gift.  As a friend of mine,\n",
      "of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,\n",
      "still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,\n",
      "you owe nothing to my solicitation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\n",
      "in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling\n",
      "to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged\n",
      "it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix\n",
      "that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it.\n",
      "For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased\n",
      "to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.\n",
      "I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother\n",
      "I know esteems him highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man,\n",
      "and in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed,\" replied Elinor, \"I believe that you will find him,\n",
      "on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be,\n",
      "and as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand\n",
      "the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,)\n",
      "it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward made no answer; but when she had turned\n",
      "away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest,\n",
      "so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish\n",
      "the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house\n",
      "much greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,\"\n",
      "said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor told him the number of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks\n",
      "which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him\n",
      "that he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted,\n",
      "with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing\n",
      "good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\n",
      "that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to\n",
      "return the same good will, than the power of expressing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself,\n",
      "as the door shut him out, \"I shall see him the husband\n",
      "of Lucy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down\n",
      "to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour\n",
      "to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course,\n",
      "to reflect on her own with discontent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned\n",
      "from seeing people whom she had never seen before,\n",
      "and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say,\n",
      "her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\n",
      "in her possession, than by anything else, that she\n",
      "reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up to the\n",
      "young man.  Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had\n",
      "no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling\n",
      "to accept your proposal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems\n",
      "all to depend upon that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really,\" said Elinor, \"I know so little of these kind\n",
      "of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time,\n",
      "or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three\n",
      "months will complete his ordination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two or three months!\" cried Mrs. Jennings; \"Lord! my dear,\n",
      "how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two\n",
      "or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME\n",
      "quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad\n",
      "to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is\n",
      "not worth while to wait two or three months for him.\n",
      "Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well;\n",
      "somebody that is in orders already.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"what can you be thinking of?--\n",
      "Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade\n",
      "me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\n",
      "ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The deception could not continue after this;\n",
      "and an explanation immediately took place, by which both\n",
      "gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any\n",
      "material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\n",
      "without forfeiting her expectation of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,\" said she,\n",
      "after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\n",
      "was over, \"and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear\n",
      "a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my\n",
      "knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I\n",
      "think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--\n",
      "and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!--\n",
      "It seems quite ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must\n",
      "touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,\n",
      "and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea\n",
      "of the living's being enough to allow them to marry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two\n",
      "thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry\n",
      "on less.  Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall\n",
      "be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas;\n",
      "and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability\n",
      "of their not waiting for any thing more.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the\n",
      "excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildings,\n",
      "that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called\n",
      "on her again the next day with her congratulations,\n",
      "that she had never seen him in such spirits before\n",
      "in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at\n",
      "least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most\n",
      "heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably\n",
      "together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.\n",
      "So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness\n",
      "to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her,\n",
      "that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most\n",
      "grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation\n",
      "to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their\n",
      "good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future,\n",
      "would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of\n",
      "doing any thing in the world for those she really valued.\n",
      "As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship\n",
      "him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that\n",
      "he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;\n",
      "anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost;\n",
      "and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford,\n",
      "as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage,\n",
      "his cows, and his poultry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now above a week since John Dashwood had\n",
      "called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no notice\n",
      "had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition,\n",
      "beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it\n",
      "necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation,\n",
      "however, which not only opposed her own inclination,\n",
      "but which had not the assistance of any encouragement\n",
      "from her companions.  Marianne, not contented with\n",
      "absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent\n",
      "to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "though her carriage was always at Elinor's service,\n",
      "so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her\n",
      "curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery,\n",
      "nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part,\n",
      "could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again.\n",
      "The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself\n",
      "to pay a visit, for which no one could really have\n",
      "less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete\n",
      "with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\n",
      "reason to dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could\n",
      "turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out.\n",
      "He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her\n",
      "that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street,\n",
      "and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her,\n",
      "invited her to come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,\" said he:--\"I\n",
      "will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not\n",
      "have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.--\n",
      "Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there\n",
      "cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always\n",
      "great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor made what excuse she could for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not sorry to see you alone,\" he replied,\n",
      "\"for I have a good deal to say to you.  This living\n",
      "of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has he really given\n",
      "it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\n",
      "coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given\n",
      "the living of Delaford to Edward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no\n",
      "relationship!--no connection between them!--and now\n",
      "that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About two hundred a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well--and for the next presentation to a living\n",
      "of that value--supposing the late incumbent to have\n",
      "been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he\n",
      "might have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.\n",
      "And how came he not to have settled that matter before this\n",
      "person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it,\n",
      "but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should\n",
      "be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural,\n",
      "concern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal\n",
      "of inconsistency in almost every human character.  I suppose,\n",
      "however--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS.\n",
      "Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\n",
      "the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough\n",
      "to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively;\n",
      "and by relating that she had herself been employed\n",
      "in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward,\n",
      "and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it\n",
      "was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is truly astonishing!\"--he cried, after hearing\n",
      "what she said--\"what could be the Colonel's motive?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be,\n",
      "Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter\n",
      "to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her,\n",
      "and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear\n",
      "it much talked of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing,\n",
      "that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure,\n",
      "an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither\n",
      "she nor her child could be possibly impoverished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Ferrars,\" added he, lowering his voice to the\n",
      "tone becoming so important a subject, \"knows nothing\n",
      "about it at present, and I believe it will be best to\n",
      "keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.--\n",
      "When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear\n",
      "of it all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why should such precaution be used?--Though\n",
      "it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have\n",
      "the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\n",
      "money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite\n",
      "out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour,\n",
      "is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her\n",
      "son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those\n",
      "over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise.\n",
      "Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\n",
      "to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--\n",
      "she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.--\n",
      "She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\n",
      "of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Elinor,\" said John, \"your reasoning is very good,\n",
      "but it is founded on ignorance of human nature.\n",
      "When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it\n",
      "his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him;\n",
      "and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\n",
      "dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one\n",
      "of the most affectionate mothers in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We think NOW,\"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause,\n",
      "\"of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance\n",
      "of her brother's tone, calmly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Choice!--how do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner\n",
      "of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether\n",
      "she marry Edward or Robert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert\n",
      "will now to all intents and purposes be considered\n",
      "as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are\n",
      "both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one\n",
      "is superior to the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short\n",
      "time silent.--His reflections ended thus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of ONE thing, my dear sister,\" kindly taking her hand,\n",
      "and speaking in an awful whisper,--\"I may assure you;--\n",
      "and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you.\n",
      "I have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the\n",
      "best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise\n",
      "it would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but\n",
      "I have it from the very best authority--not that I ever\n",
      "precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her\n",
      "daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short,\n",
      "whatever objections there might be against a certain--a\n",
      "certain connection--you understand me--it would have been\n",
      "far preferable to her, it would not have given her half\n",
      "the vexation that THIS does.  I was exceedingly pleased\n",
      "to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--\n",
      "a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.\n",
      "'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least\n",
      "evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW\n",
      "for nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out\n",

      "while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love\n",
      "and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother,\n",
      "earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that\n",

      "all the contempt it excited.  It was a look, however,\n",
      "very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave\n",
      "no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\n",

      "and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced,\n",
      "but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe;\n",
      "for on that day they were to have begun their journey home;\n",
      "and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "were to have taken their mother by surprise on the\n",
      "following forenoon.  The little she said was all in\n",
      "lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried\n",
      "to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN\n",
      "really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day produced little or no alteration in the\n",
      "state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,\n",
      "except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse.\n",
      "Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer,\n",
      "though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\n",
      "and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be\n",
      "frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last\n",
      "by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her;\n",
      "and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,\n",
      "with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\n",
      "likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away\n",
      "while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's\n",
      "account, would be to deprive them both, she thought,\n",
      "of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once\n",
      "that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,\n",
      "that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,\n",
      "while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she\n",
      "urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying\n",
      "the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\n",
      "long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed\n",
      "to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person\n",
      "so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all\n",
      "these arrangements.  She knew not that she had been\n",
      "the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away,\n",
      "in about seven days from the time of their arrival.\n",
      "It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing\n",
      "of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern,\n",
      "she never mentioned her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure,\n",
      "and her situation continued, with little variation,\n",
      "the same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every day,\n",
      "still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood\n",
      "was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\n",
      "was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined\n",
      "very early in the seizure that Marianne would never\n",
      "get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly\n",
      "of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings,\n",
      "was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.\n",
      "He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different\n",
      "judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd;\n",
      "but the many hours of each day in which he was left\n",
      "entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission\n",
      "of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from\n",
      "his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy\n",
      "anticipations of both were almost done away; for when\n",
      "Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better.\n",
      "Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable\n",
      "than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every\n",
      "pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that\n",
      "in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own\n",
      "judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light\n",
      "of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;\n",
      "and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be\n",
      "able to travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.--\n",
      "Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing\n",
      "more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before.\n",
      "Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to\n",
      "attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\n",
      "of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully\n",
      "administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with\n",
      "satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which\n",
      "she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her sleep,\n",
      "though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it,\n",
      "lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe\n",
      "the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her\n",
      "during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing\n",
      "of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed;\n",
      "her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating\n",
      "herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained\n",
      "alone with Marianne.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed;\n",
      "and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention\n",
      "her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent\n",
      "but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,\n",
      "was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber,\n",
      "when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\n",
      "in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness,\n",
      "cried out,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is mama coming?--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet,\" cried the other, concealing her terror,\n",
      "and assisting Marianne to lie down again, \"but she will\n",
      "be here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a great way,\n",
      "you know, from hence to Barton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she must not go round by London,\" cried Marianne,\n",
      "in the same hurried manner.  \"I shall never see her,\n",
      "if she goes by London.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not\n",
      "quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her,\n",
      "eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker than ever!\n",
      "and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm\n",
      "increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending\n",
      "instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger\n",
      "to Barton for her mother.  To consult with Colonel Brandon\n",
      "on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought\n",
      "which immediately followed the resolution of its performance;\n",
      "and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\n",
      "by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room,\n",
      "where she knew he was generally to be found at a much\n",
      "later hour than the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her\n",
      "difficulties were immediately before him.  Her fears,\n",
      "he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--\n",
      "he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her\n",
      "difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness\n",
      "that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service\n",
      "pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the\n",
      "messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  Elinor made no\n",
      "resistance that was not easily overcome.  She thanked him\n",
      "with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went\n",
      "to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and\n",
      "an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines\n",
      "to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel\n",
      "Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully\n",
      "was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,\n",
      "whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might\n",
      "soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD\n",
      "be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\n",
      "would lessen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all\n",
      "the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary\n",
      "arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated\n",
      "with exactness the time in which she might look for\n",
      "his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.\n",
      "The horses arrived, even before they were expected,\n",
      "and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look\n",
      "of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,\n",
      "hurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve\n",
      "o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait\n",
      "for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her\n",
      "the rest of the night.  It was a night of almost equal\n",
      "suffering to both.  Hour after hour passed away in sleepless\n",
      "pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most\n",
      "cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.\n",
      "Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all\n",
      "her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,\n",
      "for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called,\n",
      "only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress\n",
      "had always thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,\n",
      "fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she\n",
      "mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of\n",
      "poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled\n",
      "with so many days of illness, and wretched for some\n",
      "immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon\n",
      "be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,\n",
      "and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving\n",
      "too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,\n",
      "or if HE could not come, for some other advice,\n",
      "when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived.\n",
      "His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay,\n",
      "for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\n",
      "alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger\n",
      "to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh\n",
      "mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which,\n",
      "in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.  He promised\n",
      "to call again in the course of three or four hours,\n",
      "and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\n",
      "composed than he had found them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not\n",
      "being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the\n",
      "morning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,\n",
      "now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of\n",
      "the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,\n",
      "her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her\n",
      "to offer the comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.\n",
      "The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young,\n",
      "so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested\n",
      "person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion\n",
      "she had other claims.  She had been for three months\n",
      "her companion, was still under her care, and she was\n",
      "known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.\n",
      "The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite,\n",
      "was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\n",
      "considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what\n",
      "Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings\n",
      "was very sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--\n",
      "but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the\n",
      "last would produce.  His medicines had failed;--the fever\n",
      "was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more\n",
      "herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching all,\n",
      "and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call\n",
      "in further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had\n",
      "still something more to try, some more fresh application,\n",
      "of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his\n",
      "visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\n",
      "the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood.\n",
      "She was calm, except when she thought of her mother;\n",
      "but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued\n",
      "till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed,\n",
      "her thoughts wandering from one image of grief,\n",
      "one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed\n",
      "to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger\n",
      "of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition\n",
      "which Marianne's disappointment had brought on.\n",
      "Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it\n",
      "gave fresh misery to her reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a\n",
      "dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent,\n",
      "even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive\n",
      "a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited,\n",
      "watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,\n",
      "with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness,\n",
      "than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate\n",
      "her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,\n",
      "to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her\n",
      "young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--\n",
      "and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,\n",
      "told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.\n",
      "Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter,\n",
      "she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.\n",
      "Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom\n",
      "yet blessed her.  Others even arose to confirm it.\n",
      "Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor\n",
      "with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on\n",
      "her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and\n",
      "hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no\n",
      "moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at\n",
      "four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on\n",
      "a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation,\n",
      "gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne was in every respect materially better,\n",
      "and he declared her entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her\n",
      "forebodings which had been found in their late alarm,\n",
      "allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\n",
      "with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness,\n",
      "the probability of an entire recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a\n",
      "different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety.\n",
      "Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her\n",
      "doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations\n",
      "of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--\n",
      "but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\n",
      "no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction,\n",
      "silent and strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued by the side of her sister, with little\n",
      "intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear,\n",
      "satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits,\n",
      "supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and\n",
      "every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,\n",
      "in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--\n",
      "but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination,\n",
      "that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne\n",
      "at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all\n",
      "appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon\n",
      "might be expected back.  At ten o'clock, she trusted,\n",
      "or at least not much later her mother would be relieved\n",
      "from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be\n",
      "travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\n",
      "less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress\n",
      "of time which yet kept them in ignorance!\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep,\n",
      "she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.\n",
      "Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of\n",
      "dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--\n",
      "and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings\n",
      "of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion,\n",
      "to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to\n",
      "take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,\n",
      "no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was\n",
      "not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the\n",
      "sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\n",
      "left her there again to her charge and her thoughts,\n",
      "and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared\n",
      "round the house, and the rain beat against the windows;\n",
      "but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.\n",
      "Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--\n",
      "they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,\n",
      "Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment\n",
      "she heard a carriage driving up to the house;\n",
      "and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite\n",
      "of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,\n",
      "that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and\n",
      "opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth.\n",
      "She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her.\n",
      "The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\n",
      "By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it\n",
      "to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the\n",
      "excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation\n",
      "to such unexpected rapidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult\n",
      "to be calm, as at that moment.  The knowledge of what her\n",
      "mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--\n",
      "of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and\n",
      "of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was\n",
      "impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done\n",
      "was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till\n",
      "she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister,\n",
      "she hurried down stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along\n",
      "an inner lobby, assured her that they were already\n",
      "in the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she\n",
      "entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.\n",

      "Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at\n",
      "the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart\n",
      "in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand\n",
      "was already on the lock, when its action was suspended\n",
      "by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather\n",

      "forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence,\n",
      "\"that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil,\n",

      "Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with\n",
      "yet greater eagerness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We hope she is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He rose up, and walked across the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Had I known as much half an hour ago--But\n",
      "since I AM here,\"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he\n",
      "returned to his seat--\"what does it signify?--For once,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time, perhaps--let us\n",
      "be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--\n",
      "Tell me honestly\"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--\n",
      "\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.\n",
      "She began to think that be must be in liquor;--the\n",
      "strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,\n",
      "seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression\n",
      "she immediately rose, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return\n",
      "to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.--\n",
      "Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better\n",
      "recollected and explained to-morrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile,\n",
      "and a voice perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk.--\n",
      "A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was\n",
      "enough to over-set me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at\n",
      "a loss to understand what he would be at.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock,\n",
      "and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise\n",
      "since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence\n",
      "of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever\n",
      "other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,\n",
      "he was not brought there by intoxication, she said,\n",
      "after a moment's recollection,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly\n",
      "DO--that after what has passed--your coming here in\n",
      "this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice,\n",
      "requires a very particular excuse.--What is it,\n",
      "that you mean by it?\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can,\n",
      "to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW.\n",
      "I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind\n",
      "of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,\n",
      "and by convincing you, that though I have been always\n",
      "a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain\n",
      "something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth\n",
      "which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance,\n",
      "and in spite of herself made her think him sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--\n",
      "for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.--\n",
      "\"Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.\n",
      "But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable\n",
      "grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor bowed her assent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation\n",
      "on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU\n",
      "may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister,\n",
      "or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.--\n",
      "Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\n",
      "worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.\n",
      "When I first became intimate in your family, I had no\n",
      "other intention, no other view in the acquaintance\n",
      "than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain\n",
      "in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\n",
      "Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners\n",
      "could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost\n",
      "from the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing,\n",
      "when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my\n",
      "heart should have been so insensible!  But at first\n",
      "I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.\n",
      "Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement,\n",
      "giving way to feelings which I had always been too much\n",
      "in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means\n",
      "in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any\n",
      "design of returning her affection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him\n",
      "with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,\n",
      "for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer.\n",
      "Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--\n",
      "Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on\n",
      "the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied,\n",
      "\"My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive,\n",
      "always in the habit of associating with people of better\n",
      "income than myself.  Every year since my coming of age,\n",
      "or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though\n",
      "the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free;\n",
      "yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,\n",
      "it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my\n",
      "circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune.  To attach\n",
      "myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be\n",
      "thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty--\n",
      "which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting\n",
      "in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a\n",
      "thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said\n",
      "for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity,\n",
      "I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated,\n",
      "because I did not THEN know what it was to love.\n",
      "But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I\n",
      "really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity,\n",
      "to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?--\n",
      "But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,\n",
      "which her affection and her society would have deprived\n",
      "of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence,\n",
      "lost every thing that could make it a blessing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened,\n",
      "\"believe yourself at one time attached to her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood\n",
      "such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have\n",
      "done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees,\n",
      "sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life\n",
      "were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions\n",
      "were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.\n",
      "Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying\n",
      "my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly\n",
      "to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it,\n",
      "from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement\n",
      "while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.\n",
      "I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate\n",
      "on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling\n",
      "to engage my faith where my honour was already bound.\n",
      "The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,\n",
      "providing with great circumspection for a possible\n",
      "opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched\n",
      "for ever.  At last, however, my resolution was taken,\n",
      "and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,\n",
      "to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,\n",
      "and openly assure her of an affection which I had already\n",
      "taken such pains to display.  But in the interim--in the\n",
      "interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I\n",
      "could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private--\n",
      "a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin\n",
      "all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery\n",
      "took place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith\n",
      "had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some\n",
      "distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of\n",
      "her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not\n",
      "explain myself farther,\" he added, looking at her with an\n",
      "heightened colour and an enquiring eye--\"your particular\n",
      "intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise,\n",
      "and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him,\n",
      "\"I have heard it all.  And how you will explain away any\n",
      "part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess\n",
      "is beyond my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received\n",
      "the account.  Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge\n",
      "that her situation and her character ought to have been\n",
      "respected by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but at\n",
      "the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing\n",
      "to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\n",
      "and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.\n",
      "If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her\n",
      "understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself.\n",
      "Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often,\n",
      "with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which,\n",
      "for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.\n",
      "I wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured\n",
      "more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection\n",
      "for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;\n",
      "and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate\n",
      "girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion\n",
      "of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no\n",
      "apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do not think yourself\n",
      "excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding\n",
      "on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\n",
      "You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself\n",
      "in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay,\n",
      "always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly\n",
      "replied; \"I did not recollect that I had omitted to give\n",
      "her my direction; and common sense might have told her\n",
      "how to find it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion\n",
      "may be guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality\n",
      "of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing\n",
      "was against me.  The matter itself I could not deny,\n",
      "and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was\n",
      "previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my\n",
      "conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with\n",
      "the very little attention, the very little portion of my\n",
      "time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit.\n",
      "In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I\n",
      "might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality,\n",
      "good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would\n",
      "marry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally\n",
      "dismissed from her favour and her house.  The night\n",
      "following this affair--I was to go the next morning--\n",
      "was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct\n",
      "should be.  The struggle was great--but it ended too soon.\n",
      "My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her\n",
      "attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh\n",
      "that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false\n",
      "ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally\n",
      "inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.\n",
      "I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife,\n",
      "if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think\n",
      "that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do.\n",
      "A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave\n",
      "Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;\n",
      "some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking\n",
      "this engagement.  But whether I should write this apology,\n",
      "or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate.\n",
      "To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted\n",
      "whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.\n",
      "In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,\n",
      "as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw\n",
      "her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping\n",
      "never to see her again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor,\n",
      "reproachfully; \"a note would have answered every purpose.--\n",
      "Why was it necessary to call?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear\n",
      "to leave the country in a manner that might lead you,\n",
      "or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part\n",
      "of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--\n",
      "and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage,\n",
      "in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,\n",
      "however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter,\n",
      "I found her alone.  You were all gone I do not know where.\n",
      "I had left her only the evening before, so fully,\n",
      "so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!\n",
      "A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;\n",
      "and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I\n",
      "walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,\n",
      "delighted with every body!  But in this, our last interview\n",
      "of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt\n",
      "that almost took from me the power of dissembling.\n",
      "Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told\n",
      "her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I\n",
      "never shall forget it--united too with such reliance,\n",
      "such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted\n",
      "rascal I was!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were both silent for a few moments.\n",
      "Elinor first spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you tell her that you should soon return?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do not know what I told her,\" he replied, impatiently;\n",
      "\"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all\n",
      "likelihood much more than was justified by the future.\n",
      "I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother\n",
      "to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence.\n",
      "Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was miserable.\n",
      "Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\n",
      "gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge\n",
      "to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,\n",
      "that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and\n",
      "exultation to me now.  Well, I went, left all that I loved,\n",
      "and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent.\n",
      "My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,\n",
      "and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my\n",
      "own reflections so cheerful--when I looked forward\n",
      "every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton,\n",
      "the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, sir,\" said Elinor, who, though pitying him,\n",
      "grew impatient for his departure, \"and this is all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--\n",
      "That infamous letter--Did she shew it you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I saw every note that passed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did,\n",
      "for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--\n",
      "in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more\n",
      "simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--\n",
      "my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word\n",
      "was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer,\n",
      "were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart.\n",
      "To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--\n",
      "a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof\n",
      "would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe\n",
      "they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure\n",
      "they are dearer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes\n",
      "in the course of this extraordinary conversation,\n",

      "such ideas in her companion as the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that\n",

      "\"Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still\n",
      "as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many,\n",
      "many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant\n",
      "in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy\n",
      "of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,\n",
      "because time and London, business and dissipation,\n",
      "had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing\n",
      "a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,\n",
      "and chusing to fancy that she too must have become\n",
      "indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment\n",
      "as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders\n",
      "in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\n",
      "overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,\n",
      "'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--\n",
      "But this note made me know myself better.  I felt that\n",
      "she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman\n",
      "in the world, and that I was using her infamously.\n",
      "But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey\n",
      "and me.  To retreat was impossible.  All that I had to do,\n",
      "was to avoid you both.  I sent no answer to Marianne,\n",
      "intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;\n",
      "and for some time I was even determined not to call in\n",
      "Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect\n",
      "the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else,\n",
      "I watched you all safely out of the house one morning,\n",
      "and left my name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watched us out of the house!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often\n",
      "I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling\n",
      "in with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,\n",
      "as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did in Bond Street,\n",
      "there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse\n",
      "of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant\n",
      "watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing\n",
      "desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us\n",
      "so long.  I avoided the Middletons as much as possible,\n",
      "as well as everybody else who was likely to prove\n",
      "an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being\n",
      "in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,\n",
      "the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called\n",
      "at Mrs. Jennings's.  He asked me to a party, a dance at his\n",
      "house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement\n",
      "that you and your sister were to be there, I should have\n",
      "felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.\n",
      "The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--\n",
      "still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything\n",
      "that could make MY conduct most hateful.  I could not\n",
      "answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a sentence.\n",
      "But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.\n",
      "If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it\n",
      "was THEN.  With my head and heart full of your sister,\n",

      "of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman\n",
      "one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read\n",
      "its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.\n",
      "She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could\n",
      "have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it\n",

      "without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could\n",
      "he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--\n",
      "such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived\n",
      "in HIM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Colonel Brandon's character,\" said Elinor,\n",
      "\"as an excellent man, is well established.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it is\"--replied her mother seriously, \"or\n",
      "after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage\n",
      "such affection, or even to be pleased by it.  But his coming\n",
      "for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,\n",
      "is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His character, however,\" answered Elinor, \"does not rest\n",
      "on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,\n",
      "were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him.\n",
      "To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long\n",
      "and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;\n",
      "and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired,\n",
      "is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,\n",
      "that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready\n",
      "as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing\n",
      "to us in the world.  What answer did you give him?--Did you\n",
      "allow him to hope?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him\n",
      "or to myself.  Marianne might at that moment be dying.\n",
      "But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  His was\n",
      "an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion\n",
      "to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.\n",
      "Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite\n",
      "overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might,\n",
      "my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage;\n",
      "and since our arrival, since our delightful security,\n",
      "I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\n",
      "encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time,\n",
      "I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is\n",
      "not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.--\n",
      "His own merits must soon secure it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however,\n",
      "you have not yet made him equally sanguine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.--He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply\n",
      "rooted for any change in it under a great length of time,\n",
      "and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident\n",
      "of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age\n",
      "and disposition he could ever attach her.  There, however,\n",
      "he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond\n",
      "hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and\n",
      "principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,\n",
      "is exactly the very one to make your sister happy.\n",
      "And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour.\n",
      "My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not\n",
      "so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time,\n",
      "there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.--\n",
      "There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's\n",
      "eyes at times, which I did not like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother,\n",
      "without waiting for her assent, continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only\n",
      "more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they\n",
      "are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching\n",
      "to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine attention\n",
      "to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity\n",
      "is much more accordant with her real disposition, than\n",
      "the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed\n",
      "of the other.  I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby\n",
      "turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself\n",
      "the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy\n",

      "gave no offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,\"\n",
      "added Mrs. Dashwood, \"even if I remain at Barton; and in all\n",
      "probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there\n",
      "certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by,\n",
      "that would suit us quite as well as our present situation.\"\n",

      "everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know\n",

      "a good one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a\n",
      "third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over\n",

      "in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind,\n",
      "had not been long enough to make her recovery slow;\n",
      "and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence\n",
      "in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,\n",
      "within four days after the arrival of the latter,\n",
      "into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room.  When there, at her own\n",
      "particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth\n",
      "her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon\n",
      "was invited to visit her.\n",
      "\n",
      "His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered\n",
      "looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\n",
      "held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture,\n",
      "must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,\n",
      "or the consciousness of its being known to others;\n",
      "and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\n",
      "complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable\n",
      "recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind,\n",
      "brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza\n",
      "already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,\n",
      "the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\n",
      "and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than\n",
      "her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,\n",
      "and therefore watching to very different effect,\n",
      "saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose\n",
      "from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in\n",
      "the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself\n",
      "to think that something more than gratitude already dawned.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing\n",
      "visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes,\n",
      "began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER measures\n",
      "depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could\n",
      "not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel\n",
      "Brandon was soon brought, by their united request,\n",
      "to consider his own abode there as equally determinate,\n",
      "if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs. Jennings's\n",
      "united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed\n",
      "on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back,\n",
      "for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel,\n",
      "at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable\n",
      "for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure\n",
      "to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course\n",
      "of a few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day of separation and departure arrived;\n",
      "and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened\n",
      "a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full\n",
      "of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart\n",
      "from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\n",
      "Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend,\n",
      "was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he\n",
      "seemed anxious that she should engross at least half.\n",
      "Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others\n",
      "were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers,\n",
      "and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned\n",
      "to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid\n",
      "for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon\n",
      "immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne\n",
      "bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.\n",
      "Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most\n",
      "solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,\n",
      "was the office of each watchful companion, and each\n",
      "found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness\n",
      "of spirits.  To Elinor, the observation of the latter\n",
      "was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen her week\n",
      "after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish\n",
      "of heart which she had neither courage to speak of,\n",
      "nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other\n",
      "could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which,\n",
      "in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection,\n",
      "must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered\n",
      "on scenes of which every field and every tree brought\n",
      "some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent\n",
      "and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice,\n",
      "sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here,\n",
      "Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw,\n",
      "as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she\n",
      "had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural\n",
      "in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,\n",
      "and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the\n",
      "whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction\n",
      "of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner\n",
      "had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne\n",
      "turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness,\n",
      "as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\n",
      "of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could\n",
      "be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed\n",
      "at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,\n",
      "it never passed away without the atonement of a smile.\n",
      "After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;\n",
      "but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera,\n",
      "procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\n",
      "favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\n",
      "in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,\n",
      "put the music aside, and after running over the keys\n",
      "for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers,\n",
      "and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness\n",
      "as she did so, that she should in future practice much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning produced no abatement in these\n",
      "happy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a mind and body\n",
      "alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with\n",
      "more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\n",
      "Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party\n",
      "which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits\n",
      "and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered\n",
      "my strength,\" said she, \"we will take long walks together\n",
      "every day.  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down,\n",
      "and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's\n",
      "new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\n",
      "and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory,\n",
      "and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told\n",
      "they once reached.  I know we shall be happy.  I know\n",
      "the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to be\n",
      "later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner\n",
      "I shall divide every moment between music and reading.\n",
      "I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course\n",
      "of serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,\n",
      "to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.\n",
      "But there are many works well worth reading at the Park;\n",
      "and there are others of more modern production which I\n",
      "know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six\n",
      "hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month\n",
      "a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated\n",
      "so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager\n",
      "fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid\n",
      "indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing\n",
      "excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous\n",
      "self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\n",
      "remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled,\n",
      "and feared she had that to communicate which might again\n",
      "unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time\n",
      "this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  Willing therefore\n",
      "to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her\n",
      "sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it.\n",
      "But the resolution was made only to be broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had been two or three days at home, before\n",
      "the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself\n",
      "to venture out.  But at last a soft, genial morning appeared;\n",
      "such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the\n",
      "mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm,\n",
      "was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,\n",
      "in the lane before the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness\n",
      "of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\n",
      "illness required;--and they had advanced only so far\n",
      "beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill,\n",
      "the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes\n",
      "turned towards it, Marianne calmly said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand,\n",
      "\"on that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there\n",
      "I first saw Willoughby.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain\n",
      "on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\"--\n",
      "hesitatingly it was said.--\"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk\n",
      "of it now, I hope, as I ought to do.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that,\n",
      "as far as HE is concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you\n",
      "of what my feelings have been for him, but what they\n",
      "are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point,\n",
      "if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS\n",
      "acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all,\n",
      "if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked\n",
      "as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story\n",
      "of that unfortunate girl\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words\n",
      "as she answered,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you could be assured of that, you think you\n",
      "should be easy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--\n",
      "for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has\n",
      "been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must\n",
      "it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine,\n",
      "but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose\n",
      "me to\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account\n",
      "for his behaviour?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him,\n",
      "only fickle, very, very fickle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself\n",
      "on the eligibility of beginning her story directly,\n",
      "or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--\n",
      "and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne\n",
      "at last with a sigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections\n",
      "may be no more unpleasant than my own.  He will suffer\n",
      "enough in them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been;\n",
      "I compare it with yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not,\n",
      "my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know\n",
      "your judgment must censure.  My illness has made me think--\n",
      "It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection.\n",
      "Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly\n",
      "able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my\n",
      "own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance\n",
      "with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence\n",
      "towards myself, and want of kindness to others.\n",
      "I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings,\n",
      "and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led\n",
      "me to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been\n",
      "entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my\n",
      "own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.\n",
      "Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I\n",
      "did not know my danger till the danger was removed;\n",
      "but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,\n",
      "I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness\n",
      "of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God,\n",
      "and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I died,--\n",
      "in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse,\n",
      "my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful\n",
      "selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the\n",
      "murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR\n",
      "remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have consoled\n",
      "her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.\n",
      "Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected,\n",
      "or some failing indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.\n",
      "The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings,\n",
      "I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletons,\n",
      "to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,\n",
      "I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened\n",
      "against their merits, and a temper irritated by their\n",
      "very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,\n",
      "little as they deserve, I had given less than their due.\n",
      "But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged\n",
      "by me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;\n",
      "yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion\n",
      "that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was\n",
      "before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate\n",
      "of you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,\n",
      "or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those\n",
      "offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude\n",
      "which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--\n",
      "not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I\n",
      "had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every\n",
      "exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow\n",
      "to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart\n",
      "which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you,\n",
      "for or I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable\n",
      "for my sake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;\n",
      "and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest\n",
      "to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support\n",
      "which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.\n",
      "Marianne pressed her hand and replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof.\n",
      "I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering\n",
      "to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.\n",
      "They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself.\n",
      "I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my mother,\n",

      "made him sport with your affections; which afterwards,\n",
      "when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession\n",
      "of it, and which finally carried him from Barton.\n",
      "His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular,\n",

      "him happy.  His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he\n",
      "suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\n",
      "that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\n",
      "than yourself.  But does it follow that had he married you,\n",
      "he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have\n",
      "been different.  He would then have suffered under the\n",
      "pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed,\n",
      "he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife\n",
      "of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would\n",
      "have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably\n",
      "would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts\n",

      "of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents.\"\n",

      "of time upon her health.\n",

      "and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;\n",
      "and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:--\n",
      "\"We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no\n",
      "enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him\n",
      "to be still at Oxford;\" which was all the intelligence\n",
      "of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name\n",
      "was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\n",

      "on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had\n",

      "answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken\n",
      "the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's\n",
      "countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment\n",
      "afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation,\n",

      "The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was\n",
      "taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids,\n",

      "much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason\n",

      "as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood\n",

      "he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,\n",
      "no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate,\n",

      "and was not only in the rapturous profession of\n",
      "the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth,\n",
      "one of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was\n",
      "more than commonly joyful.  He had more than the ordinary\n",
      "triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise\n",
      "his spirits.  He was released without any reproach\n",
      "to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed\n",

      "too--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little\n",

      "no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I hope,\n",
      "foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since\n",

      "the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger,\n",
      "had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings,\n",

      "appearance without a friend in the world to assist me.\n",
      "In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing\n",
      "to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature,\n",
      "how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted\n",
      "on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing\n",
      "but the most disinterested affection was her inducement?\n",
      "And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur\n",
      "in your favour; that your own family might in time relent.\n",
      "And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,\n",
      "for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination\n",
      "nor her actions.  The connection was certainly a\n",
      "respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among\n",
      "her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred,\n",
      "it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that\n",

      "were THEN situated, could never be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart,\n",
      "and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH\n",

      "with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was\n",
      "to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour.  I felt\n",
      "that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship;\n",
      "and till I began to make comparisons between yourself\n",
      "and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that,\n",
      "I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,\n",
      "and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the\n",
      "expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger\n",

      "not only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an\n",
      "opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\n",
      "his giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\"\n",

      "him for offering.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet\n",
      "been to the place.  But so little interest had be taken\n",
      "in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house,\n",
      "garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of\n",
      "the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself,\n",
      "who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon,\n",

      "One question after this only remained undecided,\n",
      "between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome.\n",

      "with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\n",
      "their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make\n",
      "their happiness certain--and they only wanted something\n",
      "to live upon.  Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor\n",
      "one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could\n",
      "call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood\n",
      "should advance anything; and they were neither of them\n",
      "quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\n",

      "\n",
      "Edward was not entirely without hopes of some\n",

      "he rested for the residue of their income.  But Elinor\n",
      "had no such dependence; for since Edward would still\n",
      "be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself\n",
      "had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language\n",
      "as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,\n",
      "she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other\n",
      "purpose than to enrich Fanny.\n",
      "\n",
      "About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel\n",
      "Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction,\n",
      "and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time\n",
      "since her living at Barton, more company with her than\n",
      "her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the\n",
      "privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore\n",
      "walked every night to his old quarters at the Park;\n",
      "from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough\n",

      "but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six\n",
      "and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\n",
      "which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks,\n",
      "all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement\n",
      "of her mother's language, to make it cheerful.\n",
      "Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive.\n",
      "No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\n",
      "nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his\n",
      "visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.\n",
      "Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
      "and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done\n",
      "for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest\n",
      "of Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced\n",
      "in the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each\n",

      "Their resemblance in good principles and good sense,\n",
      "in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\n",
      "have been sufficient to unite them in friendship,\n",
      "without any other attraction; but their being in love\n",
      "with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,\n",
      "made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\n",
      "which might otherwise have waited the effect of time\n",
      "and judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters from town, which a few days before would\n",
      "have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport,\n",
      "now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her\n",
      "honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth\n",
      "her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure,\n",
      "had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,\n",
      "by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.--\n",
      "\"I do think,\" she continued, \"nothing was ever carried\n",
      "on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called\n",
      "and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul suspected\n",
      "anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!\n",
      "came crying to me the day after, in a great fright\n",
      "for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to\n",
      "get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\n",
      "money before she went off to be married, on purpose\n",
      "we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not\n",
      "seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give\n",
      "her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she\n",
      "thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess,\n",
      "in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again.\n",
      "And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them\n",
      "along with them in the chaise is worse than all.\n",
      "Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you\n",
      "must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to\n",
      "comfort him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.\n",
      "Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women--poor\n",
      "Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and he\n",
      "considered the existence of each, under such a blow,\n",
      "with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable,\n",
      "but Lucy's was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were\n",
      "ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,\n",
      "if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son,\n",
      "his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter,\n",
      "nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy\n",
      "with which everything had been carried on between them,\n",
      "was rationally treated as enormously heightening\n",
      "the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred\n",
      "to the others, proper measures would have been taken\n",
      "to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join\n",
      "with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward\n",
      "had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus\n",
      "be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--\n",

      "not a line has been received from him on the occasion.\n",
      "Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,\n",
      "and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line\n",
      "to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter\n",
      "of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny,\n",
      "and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss;\n",
      "for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart,\n",

      "with her children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This paragraph was of some importance to the\n",
      "prospects and conduct of Edward.  It determined him\n",

      "\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he;\n",
      "\"would they have me beg my mother's pardon for Robert's\n",
      "ingratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can\n",
      "make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor\n",
      "penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy;\n",

      "almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had nothing to urge against it, but still\n",
      "resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;\n",
      "and therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared\n",
      "a much greater willingness to make mean concessions\n",
      "by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that,\n",
      "instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London,\n",

      "to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.\n",
      "For many years of her life she had had two sons;\n",
      "but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago,\n",
      "had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert\n",
      "had left her for a fortnight without any; and now,\n",
      "by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of his being allowed once more to live,\n",

      "for the publication of that circumstance, he feared,\n",
      "might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry\n",
      "him off as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution\n",
      "therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with\n",
      "unexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably\n",
      "endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood,\n",
      "by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton\n",
      "he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--\n",
      "and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton\n",
      "was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,\n",
      "while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private\n",
      "gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that,\n",
      "though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\n",
      "he was by no means inclined to be guided by it,\n",
      "she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past,\n",
      "to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay\n",
      "as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent\n",
      "every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree\n",
      "of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What she would engage to do towards augmenting\n",
      "their income was next to be considered; and here it\n",
      "plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,\n",
      "he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\n",
      "inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year,\n",
      "not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking\n",
      "orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost;\n",

      "seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an income quite sufficient to their wants\n",
      "thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for\n",
      "after Edward was in possession of the living, but the\n",
      "readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon,\n",
      "with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor,\n",
      "was making considerable improvements; and after waiting\n",

      "as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays\n",
      "from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\n",
      "as usual, broke through the first positive resolution\n",

      "\n",
      "The first month after their marriage was spent\n",

      "they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage,\n",
      "and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--\n",
      "could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.\n",
      "Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together,\n",
      "were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward\n",
      "and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she\n",
      "found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed,\n",
      "one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had\n",
      "in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel\n",
      "Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for\n",
      "their cows.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were visited on their first settling by almost\n",
      "all their relations and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came\n",
      "to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\n",
      "of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at\n",

      "\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\"\n",

      "the gates of Delaford House, \"THAT would be saying too much,\n",
      "for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\n",
      "women in the world, as it is.  But, I confess, it would\n",
      "give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother.\n",
      "His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\n",
      "such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I\n",
      "have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there\n",
      "is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps,\n",
      "Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him--\n",
      "yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to\n",
      "have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\n",
      "Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what\n",
      "may happen--for, when people are much thrown together,\n",
      "and see little of anybody else--and it will always be\n",
      "in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--\n",
      "in short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand\n",
      "me.\"--\n",
      "\n",
      "But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always\n",
      "treated them with the make-believe of decent affection,\n",
      "they were never insulted by her real favour and preference.\n",
      "THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning\n",
      "of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months\n",
      "had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter,\n",
      "which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,\n",
      "was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it;\n",
      "for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions,\n",
      "and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening\n",
      "was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars\n",
      "to his choice, and re-established him completely in\n",
      "her favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair,\n",
      "and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held\n",
      "forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest,\n",
      "an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress\n",
      "may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\n",
      "advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time\n",
      "and conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,\n",
      "and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings,\n",
      "it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother.\n",
      "He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;\n",
      "and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\n",
      "of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews\n",
      "would settle the matter.  In that point, however,\n",
      "and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him\n",
      "hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME,\n",
      "another visit, another conversation, was always wanted\n",
      "to produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered\n",
      "in her mind when they parted, which could only be\n",
      "removed by another half hour's discourse with himself.\n",
      "His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest\n",
      "followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward,\n",
      "they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject\n",
      "on which he had always more to say than on any other,\n",
      "and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\n",
      "to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident\n",
      "to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.\n",
